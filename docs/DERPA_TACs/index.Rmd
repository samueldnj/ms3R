abstract: |
    Managers of multi-species fisheries aim to balance harvest of target 
    and non-target species that vary in abundance, productivity, and 
    degree of technical interactions. In this paper, we evaluated
    management performance of five surplus production stock assessment 
    methods used in such a multi-species context. Production models included 
    single-species and hierarchical multi-species models, as well as methods 
    that pooled data across species and spatial strata. Operating models 
    included technical interactions between species intended to produce 
    choke effects often observed in output controlled 
    multi-species fisheries. Average annual yield of each method under three
    data scenarios were compared to annual yield obtained by a simulated
    omniscient manager. Yield and conservation performance of hierarchical 
    multi-species models was superior to all other methods under low and
    moderate data scenarios, and superior to single-species models under 
    the higher data quantity scenario. These results were robust to a 
    wide range of prior precision in assessment model biomass parameters, 
    hierarchical prior precision for catchability and productivity, and 
    future survey precision; however, results were sensitive to prior 
    precision in assessment model productivity parameters under the low
    data scenario, where the hierarchical multi-species method dropped
    from first to fourth place, dominated by the data-pooling methods.
