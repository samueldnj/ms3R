abstract: |
    Managers of multi-species fisheries aim to balance harvest of multiple 
    interacting species that vary in abundance and productivity. Technical 
    interactions are a defining characteristic of multi-species fisheries, 
    and are often ignored when setting catch limits or target exploitation 
    rates, despite their effect on the ability to balance multi-species 
    harvest. Balancing harvest is more difficult when stock assessments are 
    impossible to perform due to data-limitations, involving *inter alia* 
    short time series of fishery independent observations, poor catch 
    monitoring, limited biological data, and spatial mismatching of 
    harvest decisions to system structure. In this paper, we asked whether 
    using hierarchical, data-limited stock assessment methods to set catch
    limits improved management performance in data-limited, multi-species
    fisheries. Management performance of five alternative 
    stock assessment methods was evaluated by using them to set harvest 
    levels targeting multi-species maximum yield in a multi-species flatfish 
    fishery, including single-species and hierarchical multi-species 
    models, and methods that pooled data across species and spatial 
    strata, with catch outcomes of each method under three data scenarios 
    compared to catch under an omniscient manager simulation. 
    Operating models included technical interactions between species
    intended to produce choke effects often observed in output 
    controlled multi-species fisheries. Hierarchical multi-species models 
    outperformed all other methods under data-poor and data-moderate 
    scenarios, and outperformed single-species models under the data-rich 
    scenario. Hierarchical models were least sensitive to prior precision, 
    sometimes improving in performance when prior precision was reduced. 
    Choke effects were found to both positive and negative effects, 
    sometimes leading to underfishing of non-choke species, but at other 
    times preventing overfishing of non-choke species. We highlight the 
    importance of including technical interactions in multi-species 
    assessment models and management objectives, how choke species can 
    indicate mismatches between management objectives and system dynamics, 
    and recommend hierarchical multi-species models for multi-species 
    fishery management systems.
