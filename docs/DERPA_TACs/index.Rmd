abstract: 
    "Management decisions in multi-species fisheries are often made on a single-species
    and single-stock basis, with TACs often set by considering the output of 
    a single-species stock assessment model. Single-species assessment methods, at best, 
    only implicitly include multi-species interactions through natural mortality and 
    recruitment process errors, which are not suitable for capturing technical interactions 
    between multiple species and fishing gear. Ignorance of technical interactions when 
    setting TACs will often lead to sub-optimal fishery outcomes, such as under-utilised TACs from choke
    effects in output-controlled fisheries. In turn, these sub-optimal outcomes may
    degrade the information linkage between stock-status and management decisions
    by lowering the statistical power of catch data, reducing the efficacy
    of stock assessment models. These issues are further compounded in situations where 
    data or management resources are limited, exemplified by short time-series of 
    fishery independent observations or limited biologica data, or the 
    structure of the management decision is mismatched to the spatial structure of the system, 
    exemplified by aggregating multiple spatial stocks or species into one management unit. In
    those situations, assessments will usually estimate an average productivity for the 
    complex, leading to underfishing for some members, and overfishing for others.
    In this paper, we simulate a spatially structured, multi-species flatfish fishery, and
    test the performance of multiple management procedures that are based on assessment methods 
    often used to deal with data limitations in multi-species fisheries, including 
    data-pooling across spatial strata or across multiple species. Procedure performance
    is measured as absolute loss in catch and biomass compared to the outcome 
    of omniscient manager simulations where the objective was to maximise
    complex yield. To include technical interactions in our management system,
    we defined harvest control rules that used the optimal equilibrum fishing effort 
    derived from the omniscient manager simulations. We found that the performance
    of a management procedure relative to omniscient management was largely
    dependent on whether the most catchable (or choke) species in each 
    area had TACs set to an optimal level. If the choke species has the 
    'optimal' TAC, and the other species in the complex had TACs that 
    would overfish, then the entire complex would be managed closer to 
    the levels of the omniscient manager. If the choke species TAC was 
    set too high, then the outcomes would be to generally overfish the
    complex, and similarly, if the choke species TAC was set too low
    then TACs would be left underfished for the complex.
