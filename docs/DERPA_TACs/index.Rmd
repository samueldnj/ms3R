abstract: 
    "The majority of harvest decisions in developed multi-species 
    fisheries are made on a single-species/single-stock basis, given 
    the output of a single-species stock assessment model. Single-species
    harvest decisions are more difficult to make in fisheries
    where single-species assessments are impossible to perform due to
    data-limitations, involving *inter alia* short time series of
    fishery independent observations, poor catch monitoring, limited
    biological data, and structural mismatching of harvest decisions
    to the spatial structure of the system. In this paper, we asked if
    using hierarchical, data-limited stock assessment methods to set
    harvest levels improved management performance in data-limited, 
    multi-species fisheries. To investigate, we simulated a multi-species
    flatfish fishery, based on a complex of three technically 
    interacting right-eyed flounders fished in three spatial 
    management areas off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. 
    We tested five surplus production 
    stock assessment models to set harvest levels, including 
    single-species assessments and hierarchical multi-species 
    assessments, and methods that pooled data across species 
    and spatial strata. Each assessment method was tested under 
    four data scenarios, which successively excluded  
    biomass indices to reduce data quantity. 
    Assessment model estimates of biomass were used to set 
    catches for each management based on an optimal harvest
    rate derived from multi-species reference points that
    explicitly include technical interactions, and 
    TACs were allocated according to relative survey biomass under 
    data-pooled assessments. Performance of the assessment models
    was measured by comparing catch outcomes against a simulated
    'omniscient manager' who is able to see future process errors
    and adjust annual fishing effort to optimise system yield. 
    

    Performance - still dependent on choke species? How do
    the alternative methods rank out?"
