abstract: 
    "Management decisions in multi-species fisheries are often made on a single-species
    and single-stock basis, with TACs often set by considering the output of 
    a single-species stock assessment model. Single-species assessment methods, at best, 
    only implicitly include multi-species interactions through natural mortality and 
    recruitment process errors, which are not suitable for capturing technical interactions 
    between multiple species and fishing gear. Ignorance of technical interactions when 
    setting TACs will often lead to sub-optimal fishery outcomes, such as under-utilised TACs from choke
    effects in output-controlled fisheries. In turn, these sub-optimal outcomes may
    degrade the information linkage between stock-status and management decisions
    by lowering the statistical power of catch data, reducing the efficacy
    of stock assessment models. These issues are further compounded in situations where 
    data or management resources are limited, exemplified by short time-series of 
    fishery independent observations or limited biologica data, or the 
    structure of the management decision is mismatched to the spatial structure of the system, 
    exemplified by aggregating multiple spatial stocks or species into one management unit. In
    those situations, assessments may either 
    In this paper, we simulate a spatially structured, multi-species flatfish fishery, and
    test the performance of multiple management procedures that are based on assessment methods 
    often used to deal with data limitations in multi-species fisheries, including 
    data-pooling across spatial strata or across multiple species. Procedure performance
    is measured as absolute or relative loss in catch and biomass compared to the outcome 
    of omniscient manager simulations. To include technical interactions in our management system,
    we defined harvest control rules that used the equilibrum fishing mortality rates 
    derived from omniscient manager simulations. We found that..."
