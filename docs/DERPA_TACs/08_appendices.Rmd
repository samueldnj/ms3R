# Appendix A: The operating model

Our operating model was based on an age- and 
sex-structured, multi-species and multi-stock population
dynamics model. We simulated the species and stocks
assuming no ecological interactions or movement
between areas. This assumption is unrealistic,
but it is how the stocks are currenly managed
so we decided that this was the best place to begin
our management simulation.



# Appendix B: Surplus production assessment model

We defined our multi-species, multi-stock surplus 
production stock assessment model as an extension 
of a model that was the subject of a previously
published sensitivity analysis of hierarchical
surplus production models [@johnson2018evaluating].
Because this model was previously published, we
only discuss the differences between the version
we used in this paper and version in the previous 
publication.

The full model is described in Table B1. 
As in the equations in the main body of this paper, 
we denote species by a subscript $s$, stock areas 
by a subscript $p$, and observation series from 
different fleets are denoted by a subscript $f$ for fleet
for all equations in Table B1.

The following list is all the extensions from the 
original model to the AM used in this paper, with
references to Table B1 in parentheses:

1. An additional shrinkage prior on Umsy_sp across
species (Equation U1)
2. Initial biomass prior for tuning purposes (Eq. B3)
3. All variance parameters were fixed

We fixed all variance parameters of the stock assessment 
model during closed loop simulations. This was required
to improve stability of the assessments during closed loop
simulations with limited data, and also allowed us 
to tune the performance of the management procedure.
