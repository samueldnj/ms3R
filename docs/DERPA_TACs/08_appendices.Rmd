# Appendix A: The operating model

The operating model was a standard age- and sex-structured 
operating model, with additional structure for multi-species 
and multi-stock population dynamics. DER complex species and 
stocks were simulated assuming no ecological interactions or 
movement between areas. The lack of movement may be unrealistic, 
especially for Dover Sole given their extent, but this is how 
the the DER complex stocks are currently managed in practice. 
The lack of ecological interactions is more realistic for Dover 
and English soles, as although both species are benthophagus, 
there is evidence that they belong to different feeding guilds
[@pikitch1987use].

DER complex abundance $N_{a,x,s,p,t}$ for age $a$, sex $x$, 
species $s$ and stock $p$ at the start of year $t$ was
given by 
\[
N_{a,x,s,p,t} = \left \{ \begin{array} {ll}
                          0.5 R_{t}  & a = 1, \\
                          N_{a-1,x,s,p,t-1} \cdot e^{-Z_{a-1,x,s,p,t-1}} & 1 < a < A, \\
                          N_{a-1,x,s,p,t-1} \cdot e^{-Z_{a-1,x,s,p,t-1}} + N_{a,x,s,p,t-1}\cdot e^{-Z_{a,x,s,p,t-1}} & a = A,
                          \end{array}
                \right.
\]
where $R_t$ is age-1 recruitment in year $t$ and $Z_{a,x,s,p,t}$
is the instantaneous total mortality rate with subscripts 
defined above.

Numbers-at-age were scaled to biomass-at-age by sex/species/area-
specific weight-at-age. Weight-at-age was an allometric function
of length-at-age
\[
w_{a,x,s,p} = \alpha_{x,s,p} \cdot L_{a,x,s,p}^{\beta_{x,s,p}}
\]
where $\alpha_{x,s,p}$ scaled between cm and kg, $\beta_{x,s,p}$
determined the rate of allometric growth, and $L_{a,x,s,p}$ was
the length in cm of a fish of age $a$, sex $x$, species $s$ and 
stock $p$. Length-at-age was given by the following Schnute 
formulation of the von-Bertalanffy growth curve [@schnute1981versatile; 
@francis2016estimating] 
\[
L_{a} = \frac{L_{A_1} - (\overline{L}_{A_2} - \overline{L}_{A_1}) \cdot \left(e^{-K A_1} - e^{-K a} )}{e^{-k A_1} - e^{-k A_2} )},
\]
where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are well spaced reference ages, 
$\overline{L}_{A_1}$ and $\overline{L}_{A_2}$ are the mean lengths
in cm of fish at ages $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $k$ is the 
growth coefficient. Note that in the growth model we dropped the sex, 
species and stock subscripts for concision.

The maturity-at-age ogive was modelled as a logistic function
\[
m_{a,s,p} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\frac{\ln 19 (a - a_{50,s,p}^{mat})}{a_{95,s,p}^{mat} - a_{50,x,s,p}^{mat}}}},
\]
where $m_{a,s,p}$ was the proportion of age-$a$ female fish 
of species $s$ in stock $p$ that were mature, and $a_{50,s,p}^{mat}$ 
and $a_{95,s,p}^{mat}$ are the ages at which 50\% and 95\% of fish 
of age-$a$, species $s$ and stock $p$ were mature.

Female spawning stock biomass was calculated as
\[
SSB_{s,p,t} = \sum_{a} N_{a,x',s,p,t} m_{a,s,p} w_{a,x',s,p}
\]


# Appendix B: Omniscient Manager Optimisation

We defined penalty functions so that inside their respective 
desired regions the penalty was zero, but outside the desired 
region the penalty grew as a cubic function. So, for example, 
a penalty designed to keep a measurement $x$ above a the desired 
region boundary $\epsilon$ is of the form
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(x , \epsilon) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    0 & x \geq \epsilon, \\
    |x - \epsilon|^2 & x < epsilon. \\
  \end{array} \right. 
\end{equation}
This form has a several advantages over
simple linear penalties, or a logarithmic barrier
penalty [@srinivasan2008tracking]. First, the cubic 
function makes the boundary threshold $\epsilon$ a soft 
boundary, which is able to be crossed if doing favours 
another portion of the objective function, and because
cubics stick closer to the $x$-axis when $|x-\epsilon| < 1$
this boundary is softer than lower degree polynomials. Second, 
making the penalty zero in the desirable region stops
the objective function from favouring regions far
from the boundaries of penalty functions, as a logarithmic
function would, for example, favouring overly conservative
effort series to keep biomass far from the lower depletion
boundary. Third, the cubic form of the penalty outside
the desired region means that the penalty function and its
first two derivatives are continuous with $x$ (**CHECK**),
allowing quasi-newton optimisation methods to be applied. Last,
the cubic polynomial actually favours small excursions
outside of the desired region when it is a net increase
in the objective function, as cubics stick closer to the
$x$-axis than lower degree polynomials.

Each penalty function is applied with a weighting, which
we used as tuning parameters. Tuning was required to balance
the relative contribution of each penalty, depending
on whether it was applied to a time series or point value,
and also to achieve realistic time series of effort or catch.
For example, commercial harvesters are unable to double or triple
effort in a short period of time, as this would require significant
capital investment or a large increase in human resources. 
Similarly, in practice harvesters are reluctant to allow catch 
to increase by more than 10% - 20% per year (**REACH OUT TO
TRAWL FOR INPUT/POSSIBLE CITATION HERE**). Similarly,
there are job-security implications for large sudden drops in
fishing effort. **Tuning criteria?**

We used a cubic spline of effort in each area to reduce
the number of free parameters in the optimisation. For each
area, 9 knot points were distributed across the full 40 year
projection, making them spaced by 5 years. We padded
the omniscient manager simulations by an extra eight
years over the stochastic simulations to avoid any
possible end effects of the spline entering the 
performance metric calculations. Effort splines
were constrained to be between 0 and 120 times the
operating model $E_{MSY,p}$, by replacing any value 
outside that range with the closest
value inside the range (i.e. negative values by *zero*,
large values by $120 E_{MSY_p}$).

<!-- From SPC revisions:

We defined penalty functions so that inside their respective 
desired acceptable regions, these penalties were zero, and 
otherwise the penalty grew as a cubic function of distance 
from the desired region. For example, a penalty designed 
to keep a performance measurement x above a the desired 
region boundary $\epsilon$ is of the form
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(x , \epsilon) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    0 & x \geq \epsilon, \\
    |x - \epsilon|^2 & x < epsilon. \\
  \end{array} \right. 
\end{equation}

This form has a several advantages over simple linear penalties, or a logarithmic barrier penalty (Srinivasan et al. 2008). First, the cubic  function makes softens the boundary threshold ϵ a soft boundary, effectively  which is able to allowing a cross-over be crossed if doing so favours another portion of the objective function. Second, , and because unlike lower degree polynomials, cubic functionss stick remain closer to the x-axis when |x-ϵ|<1.  this boundary is softer than lower degree polynomials. SecondThird, making the penalty zero penalty within the desirable region stops the objective function from favouring regions far from the boundaries of penalty functions, In contrast, a logarithmic penalty function , as a logarithmic function wouldwould , for example, favouring overly conservative effort series to keep biomass far from the lower depletion boundary. ThirdFinally, outside the desired region, the cubic form of the penalty outside the desired region means that the penalty function and its first two derivatives are continuous with x (CHECK), allowing for fast derivative-based quasi-newton optimisation methodss to be applied. Last, the cubic polynomial actually favours small excursions outside of the desired region when it is a net increase in the objective function, as cubics stick closer to the x-axis than lower degree polynomials .
