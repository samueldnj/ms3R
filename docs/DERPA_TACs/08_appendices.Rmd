# Appendix A: The operating model

Our operating model was based on an age- and 
sex-structured, multi-species and multi-stock population
dynamics model. We simulated the species and stocks
assuming no ecological interactions or movement
between areas. This assumption may be unrealistic,
but it is how the stocks are currenly managed
so we decided that this was the best place to begin
our management simulation.
