# Discussion

In this paper, we demonstrated that hierarchical stock assessment
models may improve management performance in a data-limited, multi-species 
flatfish fishery. When available data quality was moderate or poor 
(indicated here by time-series length), biomass and harvest rate estimates 
from hierarchical stock assessment models resulted in catches that were 
closer to an omniscient manager's optimal reference series compared to catch 
limits derived from single-stock and data-pooling assessment methods. Under 
high data quality scenarios, data-pooling methods outperformed hierarchical 
models, but the latter still outperformed single-stock assessment methods. 
Improved performance relative to single-stock models under lower data quality 
conditions is consistent with our previous study, where statistical performance
of hierarchical multi-stock assessments improved with decreasing data quantity 
and quality [@johnson2018evaluating]. This suggests that hierarchical assessment 
methods would generally be a better approach to making catch limit decisions 
than conventional single-species methods under typical fisheries data quality 
conditions, such as short or noisy time series of fishery-independent 
observations.

Our results arise from models that are necessarily a simplification
of the real stock-management system. The harvest rules applied to DER complex 
species were relatively simple and may require more detail or complexity 
for practical applications. All harvest rules were constant target harvest 
rates, which do not include precautionary "ramping-down" of catch towards a 
limit biomass level [@DFO2006A-Harvest-Strat; @cox2013roles]. Including a 
ramped harvest rule would reduce the probability of stocks being critically 
overfished in some cases, probably at some further cost of choke effects, but
there was very little chance of critically overfishing any stock under
our simulations anyway. Second, catch limits for the simulated DER complex 
were set based on estimated target harvest rates that were scaled by 
*a priori* known scalars derived from multi-species yield curves, which may 
positively bias results towards lower catch loss in general. Incorporating 
multi-species yield curve calculations to the assessment model ouput 
into the harvest decision would be simple to do, but would require either 
a model of increased complexity to link fishing effort to single-species 
yield, or an extra assumption linking effort to surplus production model 
yield calculations, which would likely increase assessment model errors. 
Finally, the TAC allocation model for data-pooled methods was only one 
example from a large set of potential options. Understanding the relative 
risks of data-pooling would require testing alternative allocation 
methods, which was beyond the scope of this paper.

We only considered multi-species technical interactions, which although
an important part of exploited system dynamics, are not the entire
story. Although there is limited evidence for ecological interactions among 
DER complex species [@pikitch1987use; @wakefield1984feeding], what does exist 
may influence the multi-species yield relationship with fishing effort or, as 
with technical interactions, inhibit the ability of the management system to 
meet target catch levels. For example, individual survival or growth may change 
in response to varied fishing pressure due to unmodeled linkages 
[@collie2001biological]. Yet, including such ecological interactions would 
imply a highly data rich scenario, which is counter to our focus on 
data-limited, multi-species fisheries. Furthermore, accounting for potential 
ecological interactions would require multiple OMs to test performance against 
a range of plausible hypotheses since ecological uncertainties are much 
broader in complexity and scope than technical interactions alone. Nevertheless, 
future work combining technical interactions with minimum realistic models 
for ecological interactions could help determine the extent to which assessment 
approaches affect these more complex multi-species fisheries outcomes 
[@punt1995effects]. For example, while diet overlap between the three
species is small off the coast of Oregon, the major Rock sole prey 
was recently settled pleuronectiform fishes, which may include Dover and
English sole young and therefore shift the complex equilibrium as fishing
pressure is applied, reducing predation mortality for Dover and English
sole and prey availability for Rock sole [@wakefield1984feeding; 
@collie2001biological].

Our effort model applied to the DER complex was also a simplification of
reality, where effort was limited only by the TACs in each area. 
Limiting by TACs was intended to reflect the management of the real BC 
groundfish fishery in which harvester decisions drive TAC utilisation
among target species [via increasing catchability; @punt2011calculating], 
and non-target or choke species [via decreasing catchability; 
@branch2008matching]. Changing catchability for targeting or avoidance 
could be simulated as a random walk in the projections, 
with correlation and variance based on the historical period, or perhaps
simulated via some economic sub-model that accounted for ex-vessel
prices and variable fishing costs. These economic factors could affect 
targeting and avoidance behaviour among species [@punt2011calculating;
@punt2020multispecies], as well as effort allocation among stock-areas
[@hilborn1987general; @walters1999multispecies]; however, it is not 
clear that our median results would be significantly different given
the potential magnitude of assessment model errors in data-limited
scenarios. Impacts of a detailed effort dynamics sub-model would probably
be more important in more extreme data-limited scenarios that relied
solely on fishery CPUE as an index of abundance, which we did not
test here. In fact, it would be interesting to determine whether the 
hierarchical information-sharing approach would exacerbate assessment 
model errors in the (common) context where fishery CPUE is the main 
abundance index.

Despite the limitations above, our results indicate that even in fisheries 
with long time series of catch and effort data, hierarchical multi-species 
assessment models may be preferable over typical single-species methods. 
The poor performance of the single-species models in all scenarios 
highlights the difference between data-rich (i.e., a higher quantity of data) 
and information-rich (i.e., data with higher statistical power) fisheries. 
The data-rich scenario differed from data-moderate and data-poor scenarios by 
the inclusion of a historical series of fishery dependent CPUE, which was quite 
noisy and subject to the effects of changing harvester behaviour like targeting 
(variable catchability), and therefore, additional historical CPUE data had 
little effect on cumulative catch loss under the single-species models. In 
contrast, the data-pooling procedures all ranked higher than single-species and 
multi-species models under the data-rich scenario, as they were able to leverage 
additional statistical power from the historical CPUE by effectively increasing 
the sample size through data aggregation. The superior performance of the 
hierarchical model over the single-species model under the data-rich scenario 
indicate that shared priors partially compensate for low statistical power
when setting TACs, but not as much as data-pooling. 

The data-pooled methods performed better under the Rich scenario and were
generally insensitive to priors, indicating that the data were more 
influential than priors on the TACs and allocation. This may be because 
data-pooled observation errors are biased low, being simulated 
independently of the observation errors in the component indices, and 
using the average standard deviation of the components. If aggregate 
indices pooled errors from each component index, then the resulting 
observation error variance would be additive in the components, especially 
if those errors were positively correlated, which may be the case under a 
common survey or fishery. 

One might expect that data-pooled methods would outperform other methods 
as future precision in the Synoptic survey was increased, amplifying the
pooling advantage, but this was not the case. The lack of dominance 
by the pooled methods was caused by the allocation model and, when pooled
over space, the pooling method. The allocation model allocated TAC in 
proportion to Synoptic survey index, which was biased away from absolute
stock size by the Synoptic trawl efficiency parameter, leading to 
under-allocation for some species/areas and choke constraints. When
data were pooled over areas, the alternating biennial observations
caused a sawtooth pattern as low and high biomass areas dominated
the pooled index, which inflated the observation errors independent
of the survey precision.

We showed that choke effects are not a uniformly negative outcome for 
multi-species fisheries, and may indicate a mismatch between the target
harvest rate and optimal complex yield. The usual assumption is that 
choke species restrict access to fishing grounds, decreasing profitability 
through lost yield of target species, and higher quota prices for choke species
[@mortensen2018identifying]; however, we found that choke species 
sometimes prevented overfishing when TACs for the non-choke species were 
set too high, allowing harvest strategies to meet multi-species
objectives despite large assessment errors for individual species
in the complex. In reality, choke effects would likely be lessened 
by changing species catchability via harvester targeting and avoidance,
creating a more complex relationship between effort and complex
yield; but, the existence of a choke species would still indicate 
a mismatch between an individual species' TAC and the optimal exploitation 
rate for meeting the management objectives for the multi-species complex.


<!-- A logical next step for practical application of hierarchical AMs in 
multi-species fishery management systems would be to tune AMs and harvest 
rules so that they meet given catch and biomass objectives. The closed loop 
feedback simulation presented above was not tuned at all, despite the 
objective of achieving multi-species maximum yield implied by the constant 
harvest rate rule, and it is unclear whether it would be possible to tune 
this system to achieve any catch or biomass objectives that ignore 
multi-species interactions. For example, the multi-species yield-effort 
relationships show that it is impossible to simultaneously fish all stocks 
at their individual maximum yield under equilibrium dynamics. Even so, the 
technical interactions model is simplified and may not reflect reality for 
long, as it excludes time-varying behaviour such as targeting of different 
DER complex species. Therefore, for multi-species fisheries it may be better 
to define biomass objectives as limits to be avoided with high probability 
(e.g., the critically overfished level of $0.4 B_{MSY,SS}$ that was succesfully
avoided by the omniscient manager over 97\% of the time) and tune HRs and 
AM outputs to maximise catch or economic yield subject to that limit, 
effectively folding in single-species conservation objectives while avoiding 
defining biomass targets based on potentially spurious estimates
of technical interactions [@moffitt2016moving].

## Conclusion

Hierarchical multi-species assessment models can outperform single-species 
assessment models in meeting multi-species harvest objectives across 
data-rich, data-moderate, and data-poor scenarios, while avoiding
states of conservation concern with high probability. While hierarchical 
model estimates of biomass used for setting TACs were sometimes more 
biased than those produced by other methods, negatively correlated bias in 
biomass and productivity was better matched under hierarchical models than
the other methods as data quantity was reduced, which translated into 
more optimal TACs and better management performance across the multi-species 
flatfish fishery. We recommend that assessment and management of multi-species 
fisheries include hierarchical models and acknowledge technical interactions 
when designing harvest strategies and management procedures for data-limited, 
multi-species fisheries aimed at achieving strategic objectives. Otherwise, 
management procedures and harvest strategies based on single-species approaches 
that rely heavily on prior knowledge (inducing bias) and ignore technical 
interactions (making objectives impossible to achieve) may give a misleading 
picture of the expected management performance in data-limited, multi-species 
fisheries.
