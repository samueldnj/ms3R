# Discussion


Major points from intro:
1. Optimal harvest rates (ref pts) in multi-species fisheries
2. Technical interactions/choke effects
3. Data limited stock assessments
4. Hierarchical methods


## Synopsis and interpretation


In this paper, we demonstrated how using hierarchical stock assessment
models to set catch limits may improve management performance in
a data-limited, multi-species flatfish fishery. When available data 
series were shorter (data-moderate and data-poor scenarios), catch limits 
set based on biomass estimates from hierarchical stock assessment models 
had lower catch loss compared to an omniscient manager's optimal reference 
series than when catch limits were set using single-stock and data-pooling 
models. When data series were longest (data-rich scenarios), catch-loss 
was lowest under data-pooling assessment models, but hierarchical models 
still outperformed single-stock models on average. Improved performance
relative to the data-pooling AMs under lower data quality conditions
is consistent with our previous study, where statistical performance
of hierarchical multi-stock assessments improved with decreasing 
data quantity and quality [@johnson2018evaluating].

Our results may indicate that, even in fisheries with long time
series of catch and effort data, hierarchical multi-stock AMs are 
preferable over single-stock AMs. The poor performance of the single-stock 
models in all scenarios highlights the difference between data-rich (i.e., a 
higher quantity of data) and information-rich (i.e., data with higher statistical 
power) fisheries. The data-rich scenario differed from data-moderate 
and data-poor scenarios by the inclusion of a historical series of fishery 
dependent CPUE, which was quite noisy and subject to the 
effects of changing harvester behaviour like targeting (variable catchability), 
and therefore, additional historical CPUE data had little effect on cumulative 
catch loss under the single-stock models. In contrast, 
the data-pooling procedures all performed better under the data-rich 
scenario, as they were able to leverage additional statistical power from
the historical CPUE by effectively increasing the sample size 
through data aggregation. Although data aggregation was impossible
for the hierarchical models, the results under the data-rich
scenario indicate that shared priors at least partially compensated 
for low statistical power by importing information between stocks 
and species.

We observed a dual effect of control under catch limits set by 
the HMS models in the data-poor scenario, where uninformative
catch series trapped assessment model estimates in

 a persistent 
negative assessment error coupled with 


Most harvest policies are truly single-species, regardless
of technical interactions, and despite whether they are indeed
possible to achieve or not. We found that under the conditions
tested, it's possible to maximise system yield while avoiding
critically overfished levels. This may be different for other
cases with different mixes of relative catchabilities and 
productivities. 


From notes:

2. While we didn't explicitly calculate biomass loss (deviations
of stock biomasses from the optimal trajectory under the omniscient
manager), we did consider biomass in relation to a critically 
overfished level, which may be the real issue from a conservation
standpoint as biomass above that level is of little concern. 
Catch performance may be acceptable given larger stock size
to go with the lower harvest rate
3. 
4. Technical interactions are not the whole ball game - what did
we mean by that? Positive and negative outcomes, highlighting that
a choke effect might not indicate that you need to raise the choke
species TAC to improve access to other TACs. It may be that the
TACs for choke species are adequately scaled and are in fact
rescuing the other species from overfishing.







TAC utilisation issue highlights two things: TACs should
definitely consider technical interactions, and that
being choked out by other species does not necessarily
mean that the choke species TAC is set too low  - it may
be that the TAC being choked is set too high by a positive
assessment error. Care must be taken to avoid the latter
situation if attempting to include technical interactions
in a management/decision system. Targeting also
plays a role [@branch2008matching].

Second takeaway: TAC utilisation issue? Optimal biomass
under Fmsy_MS? Need to drop fishing to historic lows
in some replicates highlights that development is not
necessarily a bonanza...


For DER model paper:

The theoretical optima from the multi-species complex yield curves 
was counter to our expectations. We expected that the optimal 
approach to managing a multi-species complex was to optimally 
exploit the largest stock in each area, while letting the 
others reach their own equilibria at the effort level required
to exploit the largest stock. What we found shows that the
exact level of technical interactions between species plays 
a large part in the way that optimal management plays out...

We recommend that when attempting to include multiple species
in allocating scientific resources to help make  decisions, that 
the relative vulnerability of each stock be taken into account. 
Those stocks that are "more available" to the fishing gear will
have their TACs filled faster, so it is more important 
that those TACs are set to the appropriate level. Technical
interactions will then protect stocks that have large positive 
assessment errors through lower TAC utilisation ratios.


under the omniscient manager's effort allocations, all stocks 
satisfy Canadian sustainable fisheries framework criteria
for fishery management despite targeting a fishing
mortality rate higher than the equilibrium 
[@DFO2006A-Harvest-Strat].

Sensitivity:

Limitations:
1. Informative priors were necessary for stability
of some MPs, sensitivity analysis highlights some of this
2. In practice, modelss were not tuned
4. Effort dynamics: simplified, would require more empirical
work for an application - e.g. targeting was not included and
would change relative catchabilities (@punt2011calculating; 
@punt2020multispecies), and time-varying catchability
would be more realistic
5. Catch limits were set based on known optimal harvest rates,
so the ability of the AMs to estimate species productivity was 
not tested as part of the closed loop feedback sims. Only way
to test this is to include the multi-species reference point
calcs as part of the MP - not too difficult to implement, but
would require an AM of higher complexity
6. Allocation model was simplified, and only one of an infinite
set of options. Understanding risk of data-pooling more deeply
would require testing different ways to allocate pooled quota.
7. Low recruitment errors
8. Harvest rates were derived from BRPs including technical
interactions but not ecological interactions or movement
between areas. Although there is limited evidence for the
D-E sole interactions, there may be some evidence for Rock
sole, which would then
9. The errors on data-pooled indices were independent
of the errors on non-pooled indicies, which may favourably
bias the pooled AMs results, especially if errors were
positively correlated, leading to an increase in average
variance.


Further work:
- While considering technical interactions, is it possible 
to tune all stocks to a nominated level? Probably not.
- Addition of economic yield [@punt2020multispecies]
- Investigation including EB/SB ratios
for data-pooled MS complexes [@winker2020jabba]
- Targeting behaviour [@punt2011calculating]
- Combining harvest control rules with multi-species
target harvest rates, that maximise system yield (MS
objective) while avoiding critically overfished
states (SS objective)


## Conclusion

Closed loop feedback simulation is a valuable tool for evaluating
risk associated with applying a fishery management strategy.

e recommend that when attempting to include multiple species
in allocating scientific resources to help make  decisions, that 
the relative vulnerability of each stock be taken into account. 
Those stocks that are "more available" to the fishing gear will
have their TACs filled faster, so it is more important 
that those TACs are set to the appropriate level. Technical
interactions will then protect stocks that have large positive 
assessment errors through lower TAC utilisation ratios.
