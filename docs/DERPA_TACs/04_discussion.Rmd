# Discussion

In this paper, we compared the management performance 
of five alternative management procedures for use in a simulated 
spatially diverse, data-limited, multi-species flatfish fishery. 
We conditioned our flatfish fishery operating model on an 
age-structured hierarchical multi-species multi-stock stock 
assessment model, and simulated data quality by adjusting the
amount of noise in survey observations used for management. 
Simulated procedures then either treated stocks as independent 
in assessments, or grouped stocks together by either pooling
data or using a hierarchical multi-stock assessment model; all
AMs were different configurations of the same assessment model, 
which extended a model from previous research [@johnson2018evaluating].
Biomass and management parameter estimates were then used 
to set TACs, and if data were pooled, TACs were split among
stocks and species in proportion with survey observations.



Main takeaway: which performed best/was most stable under
changes in obs error variances?

Second takeaway: TAC utilisation issue? Optimal biomass
under Fmsy_MS? Need to drop fishing to historic lows
in some replicates highlights that development is not
necessarily a bonanza...

This indicates that,
under the omniscient manager's effort allocations, all stocks 
satisfy Canadian sustainable fisheries framework criteria
for fishery management despite targeting a fishing
mortality rate higher than the equilibrium 
[@DFO2006A-Harvest-Strat].

Sensitivity:

Limitations:
1. Informative priors were necessary for stability
of some MPs
2. Addition of  biomass and CPUE indices instead 
of re-calculation under coastwide and data-pooled MPs
4. Effort dynamics: simplified, would require more empirical
work for an application - e.g. landed value is assumed equal
among fish (not far from the truth anyways)
5. 

Further work:
- While considering technical interactions, is it possible 
to tune all stocks to a nominated level? Probably not.
- Addition of economic yield (@punt2020multispecies)
- Investigation of how to better include EB/SB ratios
for data-pooled MS complexes [@winker2020jabba]
