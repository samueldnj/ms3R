# Discussion

In this paper, we compared the management performance 
of five alternative assessment models in a simulated 
spatially structured, data-limited, multi-species flatfish fishery. 
Our operating model was an age- and sex-structured population
dynamics model based on the DER complex in British Columbia,
Canada, and we simulated different data quality scenarios by 
excluding different data series from surplus production
stock assessment models used to set annual total allowable
catches for each stock. Simulated surplus production 
assessment models either treated stocks as independent, 
or grouped stocks together by pooling data or 
using a hierarchical multi-stock assessment model. Each
assessment model forecast future biomass values set TACs 
by applying a constant harvest rate policy, with harves rates derived
from multi-species maximum yield incorporating technical
interactions.

All AMs were different
configurations of the same assessment model, which extended 
a model from previous research [@johnson2018evaluating].

Measured performance using catch and biomass loss,
catch and biomass tradeoffs

Main takeaway: which performed best/was most stable under
changes in data series?

As expected, all data-limited methods (data-pooling and 
hierarchical) outperformed the single-stock methods
in all scenarios. In more data-rich scenarios, the 
data-pooling AMs had the lowest biomass and catch loss

TAC utilisation issue highlights two things: TACs should
definitely consider technical interactions, and that
being choked out by other species does not necessarily
mean that the choke species TAC is set too low  - it may
be that the TAC being choked is set too high by a positive
assessment error. Care must be taken to avoid the latter
situation if attempting to include technical interactions
in a management/decision system. Targeting also
plays a role [@branch2008matching].




Second takeaway: TAC utilisation issue? Optimal biomass
under Fmsy_MS? Need to drop fishing to historic lows
in some replicates highlights that development is not
necessarily a bonanza...


For DER model paper:

The theoretical optima from the multi-species complex yield curves 
was counter to our expectations. We expected that the optimal 
approach to managing a multi-species complex was to optimally 
exploit the largest stock in each area, while letting the 
others reach their own equilibria at the effort level required
to exploit the largest stock. What we found shows that the
exact level of technical interactions between species plays 
a large part in the way that optimal management plays out...

We recommend that when attempting to include multiple species
in allocating scientific resources to help make  decisions, that 
the relative vulnerability of each stock be taken into account. 
Those stocks that are "more available" to the fishing gear will
have their TACs filled faster, so it is more important 
that those TACs are set to the appropriate level. Technical
interactions will then protect stocks that have large positive 
assessment errors through lower TAC utilisation ratios.


under the omniscient manager's effort allocations, all stocks 
satisfy Canadian sustainable fisheries framework criteria
for fishery management despite targeting a fishing
mortality rate higher than the equilibrium 
[@DFO2006A-Harvest-Strat].

Sensitivity:

Limitations:
1. Informative priors were necessary for stability
of some MPs
2. Addition of  biomass and CPUE indices instead 
of re-calculation under coastwide and data-pooled MPs
4. Effort dynamics: simplified, would require more empirical
work for an application - e.g. landed value is assumed equal
among fish (not far from the truth anyways)
5. Targeting was not included
6. 

Further work:
- While considering technical interactions, is it possible 
to tune all stocks to a nominated level? Probably not.
- Addition of economic yield [@punt2020multispecies]
- Investigation of how to better include EB/SB ratios
for data-pooled MS complexes [@winker2020jabba]
- Targeting behaviour [@punt2011calculating]
