# Introduction


The majority of harvest decisions in developed multi-species 
fisheries are made on a single-species/single-stock basis. 
Single-species harvest decisions often ignore the fact
that fishing is inherently non-selective, and therefore
in most cases results the simultaneous catch of multiple
species, which are said to have technical interactions
[@punt2002evaluation]. Ignorance of technical interactions 
among species while setting TACs in multi-species fisheries will often 
lead to sub-optimal fishery outcomes [@ono2017management;
@punt2011calculating]. For example, under-utilisation of TAC 
could occur when multiple technically interacting quota species 
are caught with very different gear availability (catchability), 
leading to one species quota being filled faster than the others 
and creating a choke point in the management system 
[@baudron2015adverse].

Difficulties setting optimal harvest rates are 
compounded in data-limited fisheries, where data or
financial resources are insufficient to extend 
single-species stock assessments [@Carruthers2014Evaluating]. 
Data limitations or low commercial value often preclude 
applying the best tools of modern fisheries science (e.g., 
age-structured stock assessments, or Management Strategy 
Evaluation) to all species in a multi-species
fishery. Data pooling is often used to extend stock assessments to 
complexes of multiple stocks of similar, interacting species
of fish, where similar may be defined in a biological
sense, or in a sense related to management unit 
boundaries [@gaichas2012assembly]. More recently, hierarchical stock 
assessment models are being applied to extend assessments 
in multi-species and multi-stock complexes where better data exists 
for some subgroup of the complex, and there are biological reasons 
to expect biological parameters to be similar among species in
the complex [@thorson2015giants]. For example, 
estimates of management parameters and stock status are improved in 
scenarios where data is of low statistical power (i.e., short 
time series or noisy observations) when hierarchical multi-stock 
surplus production models penalise survey catchability and intrinsic
growth rate by shrinkage priors, compared to single-stock
models fit to the same data [@johnson2018evaluating].

Although hierarchical stock assessments perform better 
on limited data under simulation self-tests than single-stock 
methods, it is unclear if hierarchical stock assessment
methods lead to better management outcomes than single-stock
or data-pooled methods. Most research on stock assessment
and harvest strategy performance in multi-stock and multi-species 
fisheries has been focused on mismatches between the spatial 
scales of harvest decision and the true underlying stock
dynamics [@benson2015evaluating; @punt2018estimates], or on the 
comparative performance when considering technical interactions 
between target and non-target (bycatch) species when setting 
catch limits based on independent single-species stock 
assessments [@ono2017management]. Further, research on 
hierarchical stock assessment procedures has been focused 
on assessment bias under different levels of model 
complexity [@punt2011among; @jiao2016integrating;
@jiao2011poor; @jiao2009hierarchical; @johnson2018evaluating].

In this paper, we investigated if hierarchical 
stock assessment models improved management performance
in a multi-species, data-limited fishery with technical
interactions. Our study system was modeled on a complex 
of Dover sole, English sole, and southern rock sole - 
three species of right-eyed flounders (*Pleuronectidae 
spp.*) fished off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, 
in three management areas. These three species co-occur 
along the BC coast, are caught together in directed trawl 
fisheries, and are surveyed by the same multi-species trawl 
survey. While time series of catch and commercial CPUE exist 
for all species and areas since the 1950s, all fishery 
independent observation series are quite noisy and some 
are very short, making this complex a good candidate for 
the application of data-limited stock assessment methods.

We used closed-loop simulation to test management
performance when harvest decisions were made based 
on outputs from five alternative assessment model 
structures, under four data scenarios. Assessment models 
included single-stock methods,
hierarchical multi-stock methods, and three 
data-pooling methods: spatial aggregation (across management 
units), species aggregation (within a management unit), 
and total aggregation (both species and spatial). 
Data-pooled harvest decisions were allocated among 
species and stocks relative to their most recent 
fishery-independent survey biomass index. Data scenarios
successively moved from the longest set of time series
of biomass indices, to only the most recent (and shortest) 
fishery indepent index. Performance of each assessment model 
was measured as absolute and relative loss in catch compared
to the catch that was taken under harvest decisions made 
by a simulated omniscient manager, who can see future 
recruitments and adjust annual effort to maximise total 
complex yield [@walters1998evaluation;@walters2004fisheries].



<!-- Single-species management often ignores the fact that fishing is inherently non-selective,
and therefore in most cases, fishing effort results in the
simultaneous catch of multiple species, which are said to 
have technical interactions [@punt2002evaluation]. Management decisions, 
such as setting total allowable catches (TACs), are often made for
a given species based on the output of species specific
stock assessments, if they even exist. Those single-species 
assessments, at best, are only able to implicity include 
multi-species ecological interactions in the form of 
natural mortality rates and recruitment process errors 
[@albertsen2017connecting], but are completely unable 
to explicitly capture technical interactions.  -->

<!-- Ignorance of technical interactions among species 
while setting TACs in multi-species fisheries will often 
lead to sub-optimal fishery outcomes [@ono2017management;
@punt2002evaluation]. For example, under-utilisation of TAC 
could occur when multiple technically interacting quota species 
are caught with very different gear availability (catchability), 
leading to one species quota being filled faster than the others 
and creating a choke point in the management system 
[@baudron2015adverse]. In turn, the under-utilised TACs may 
create uninformative catch data, which can degrade stock assessment 
performance over successive fishing seasons, and may 
create a reinforcing feedback loop that will lead to 
reduced data quality in the long term. If unarrested, 
data quality reducing feedback loops could weaken the 
information linkage required to take management 
actions commensurate with stock status. -->

<!-- Difficulties linking management decisions to stock 
status are compounded when data or management resources 
are limited [@Carruthers2014Evaluating].
Data limitations or low commercial value often preclude 
extending the best management practices (e.g., 
Management Strategy Evaluation) to all species in a multi-species
fishery. Data pooling is often used to extend stock assessments to 
complexes of multiple stocks of similar, interacting species
of fish, where similar may be defined in a biological
sense, or in a sense more related to overlapping management unit 
boundaries [@gaichas2012assembly]. More recently, hierarchical stock 
assessment models are being applied to extend assessments 
in multi-species and multi-stock complexes where better data exists 
for some subgroup of the complex, and there are biological reasons 
to expect biological parameters to be similar among species in
the complex [@thorson2015giants]. For example, 
estimates of management parameters and stock status are improved in 
scenarios where data is of low statistical power (i.e., short 
time series or noisy observations) when hierarchical multi-stock 
surplus production models penalise survey catchability and intrinsic
growth rate by shrinkage priors, compared to single-stock
models fit to the same data [@johnson2018evaluating]. -->




<!-- In this paper, we simulated a spatially structured, 
multi-species flatfish fishery, and tested the performance 
of multiple management procedures that were based on assessment 
methods that are often used to deal with data limitations in 
multi-species fisheries. We conditioned our simulated fishery 
on the complex of Dover, English, and Rock soles in British Columbia, 
Canada [*Pleuronectidae spp*]. These three species 
co-occur along the BC coast, are caught 
together in directed trawl fisheries, and are surveyed by 
the same multi-species trawl survey. While time series
of catch and commercial CPUE exist for all species and 
areas since the 1950s, all fishery independent observation 
series are quite noisy and some are very short, making this 
complex a good candidate for the application of data-limited 
stock assessment methods. We tested both single-stock and 
hierarchical multi-stock surplus production assessment models 
[@johnson2018evaluating], with skewed yield curves to match 
simulated age-structured populations based on on the 
JABBA-Select model [@winker2018jabba; @winker2020jabba]. 
We also tested data aggregation methods, including across spatial 
strata (coastwide models), across multiple species within a 
stratum (data-pooled), or total aggregation. Management procedure 
performance was measured as absolute or relative loss in catch and 
biomass compared to the outcome of simulations where an 
omniscient manager is maximising total system yield 
[@walters1998evaluation]. To include technical interactions 
in our simulated fishery system, we derived a commercial
catchability ratio between fishing effort and mortality
for each species/stock combination, and allowed future
fishing effort to increase until at least one TAC was fully
utilised, representing a fully integrated output 
control fishery with technical interactions, as in 
British Columbia's trawl fishery. Total allowable catches 
were set as constant removal rates based on either multi-species 
optimal harvest rates, derived from adding single-species 
yield curves with respect to effort [@mueter2006using; 
@punt2020multispecies], or traditional single-species 
optimal harvest rates derived from the operating model 
yield curves.  -->
