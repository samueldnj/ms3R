# Introduction


Managers of multi-species fisheries aim to balance harvest of multiple
interacting target and non-target species that vary in abundance and
productivity. Among-species variation in productivity implies 
variation in single-species optimal harvest rates, and, therefore,
differential responses to exploitation. Single-species optimal harvest 
rates (e.g., the harvest rate associated with maximum sustainable 
yield) typically ignore both multi-species trophic interactions that
influence individual demographic rates [@gislason1999single; 
@collie2001biological], and technical interactions that make it virtually 
impossible to simultaneously achieve the optimal harvest rate for all 
species [@pikitch1987use]. 

Technical interactions among species that co-occur in non-selective 
fishing gear are a defining characteristic of multi-species fisheries 
[@pikitch1987use; @punt2002evaluation] and, therefore, play a central 
role in multi-species fisheries management outcomes for individual 
species [@ono2017management; @kempf2016msy]. Catch limits set 
for individual species without considering technical interactions 
subsequently lead to sub-optimal fishery outcomes [@ono2017management; 
@punt2011calculating; @punt2020multispecies]. For example, under-utilization 
of catch limits could occur when technically interacting quota species are 
caught at different rates (i.e., catchability) by a common gear, leading 
to a choke constraint in which one species quota is filled before the 
others [@baudron2015adverse]. Choke constraints are considered negative 
outcomes for multi-species fishery performance, because they reduce 
harvester profitability as increasingly rare quota for choke species may 
limit access to fishing grounds, as well as driving quota costs above the 
landed value of the choke species [@mortensen2018identifying].

Setting catch limits for individual species in any fishery usually
requires an estimate of species abundance, which continues to be
a central challenge of fisheries stock assessment 
[@hilborn1992quantitative; @quinn2003ruminations; @maunder2015contemporary], 
especially when species data are insufficient for stock assessment models. 
Where such data limitations exist, data pooling is sometimes used to 
extend stock assessments to complexes of similar, interacting stocks of 
fish [@appeldoorn1996model]. A couple of examples include pooling data 
for a single species across multiple spatial strata when finer scale data 
are unavailable or when fish are believed to move between areas at a 
sufficiently high rate [@benson2015evaluating; @punt2018estimates], and 
pooling data for multiple species of the same taxonomic group within an area 
when data are insufficient for individual species or during development
of new fisheries [@demartini2019hazards]. Data-pooled estimates of 
productivity represent means across the species complex; therefore the 
general cost of such pooling approaches is that catch limits will tend to 
overfish unproductive species and underfish productive ones 
[@gaichas2012assembly]. 

In multi-species and/or multi-area contexts, hierarchical stock assessment 
models, which treat each area/species combination as an individual yet 
exchangeable replicate, may represent a compromise between single-species 
approaches and data-pooling approaches.  For this paper, we define a 
hierarchical stock assessment model as a model fit to multiple replicates 
(e.g. areas/species) simultaneously, using hierarchical hyper-priors on 
replicate-specific parameters to share information between replicates 
[@thorson2015giants]. Hierarchical priors induce parameter shrinkage, which 
draws parameters towards an estimated mean value, improving model convergence 
for data-poor replicates while still estimating replicate-specific parameters 
based on available data. Replicate specific estimates based on data stand in 
contrast to data-pooled methods which estimate a mean value only, or 
single-stock methods that may rely on strong *a priori* assumptions like 
fixed values, forcing parameters to be identical among replicates, or using 
strongly informative priors, all of which will almost certainly increase 
assessment bias as those strong assumptions are difficult to formulate 
in data-limited contexts [@jiao2009hierarchical; @jiao2011poor; 
@punt2011among].

Although hierarchical stock assessments produce better
estimates of species biomass and productivity than single-species
methods in data-limited contexts, it remains unclear whether 
such improved statistical performance translates into better 
management outcomes [@johnson2018evaluating]. Aside from some related 
simulations determining the benefits of manually sharing information 
gained when actively adaptively managing spatially replicated groundfish 
stocks [@collie1991adaptive], to our knowledge there are no evaluations 
of the management performance of hierarchical stock assessment models. 
Further, low assessment model bias and/or high precision, which are
often unattainable outside of simulation, aren't necessary conditions 
for superior management performance, as in practice biases can sometimes 
compensate for each other (e.g., negative correlation in stock size and 
productivity), or be compensated for by other parts of the management 
system, such as a reduction in harvest rate. A modern fisheries management 
oriented paradigm is more concerned with the expected performance 
a fisheries management system - made up of data, assessments, and harvest 
rules - despite the inherent, and at some point irreducible, uncertainties
in the system [@de-la-Mare1998Tidier-fisherie].

In this paper, we investigated whether hierarchical stock assessment models 
improved management performance in a simulated multi-species, spatially
replicated, data-limited fishery. The simulated fishery was modeled on a 
spatially heterogeneous complex of Dover sole (*Microstomus pacificus*), 
English sole (*Parophrys vetulus*), and southern Rock sole 
(*Lepidopsetta bilineata*), fished off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, 
in three spatial management areas. Closed-loop feedback simulation was used 
to estimate fishery outcomes when catch limits were set based on estimates 
of biomass from single-species, data-pooling, and hierarchical
state-space surplus production models under three data scenarios. 
Assessment models were either fit to species specific data as 
single-species or hierarchical multi-species models, or fit to data 
pooled spatially across management units, pooled across species 
within a spatial management unit, or totally aggregated across 
both species and spatial management units. Management performance of 
each assessment approach was measured as cumulative absolute loss in 
catch, measured against optimal catch trajectories generated by an 
omniscient manager, who could set annual effort to maximize total
multi-species/multi-stock complex yield given perfect knowledge of all
future recruitments [@walters1998evaluation; @martell2008retrospective].
