# Introduction


Managers of multi-species fisheries aim to balance harvest of multiple
interacting target and non-target species that vary in abundance and
productivity. Among-species variation in productivity implies 
variation in single-species optimal harvest rates, and, therefore,
differential responses to exploitation. Single-species optimal harvest 
rates (e.g., the harvest rate associated with maximum sustainable 
yield) typically ignore both multi-species trophic interactions that
influence species' demographic rates [@gislason1999single; 
@collie2001biological], and technical interactions that make it virtually 
impossible to simultaneously achieve the optimal harvest rates for all 
species [@pikitch1987use]. 

Technical interactions among species that co-occur in non-selective 
fishing gear are a defining characteristic of multi-species fisheries 
[@pikitch1987use; @punt2002evaluation] and, therefore, play a central 
role in multi-species fisheries management outcomes for individual 
species [@ono2017management; @kempf2016msy]. Catch limits set 
for individual species without considering technical interactions 
subsequently lead to sub-optimal fishery outcomes [@ono2017management; 
@punt2011calculating; @punt2020multispecies]. For example, under-utilization 
of catch limits could occur when technically interacting quota species are 
caught at different rates (i.e., catchability) by a common gear, leading 
to a choke constraint in which one species quota is filled before the 
others [@baudron2015adverse]. Choke constraints are considered negative 
outcomes for multi-species fishery performance, because they reduce 
harvester profitability as increasingly rare quota for choke species may 
limit access to fishing grounds, as well as driving quota costs above the 
landed value of the choke species [@mortensen2018identifying].

Setting catch limits for individual species in any fishery usually
requires an estimate of species abundance, which continues to be
a central challenge of fisheries stock assessment 
[@hilborn1992quantitative; @quinn2003ruminations; @maunder2015contemporary], 
especially when species data are of low statistical power,
such as short noisy time series of observations, or uninformative
catch series [@johnson2018evaluating]. Where such low power data 
exists, data pooling is sometimes used to extend stock 
assessments to complexes of similar, interacting stocks of 
fish [@appeldoorn1996model]. Examples include pooling data for a single 
species across multiple spatial strata when finer scale data 
are unavailable or when fish are believed to move between areas at a 
sufficiently high rate [@benson2015evaluating; @punt2018estimates], and 
pooling data for multiple species of the same taxonomic group within an area 
when data are insufficient for individual species or during development
of new fisheries [@demartini2019hazards]. Data-pooled estimates of 
productivity represent means across the species complex, implying that
resulting catch limits will tend to overfish unproductive species and 
underfish productive ones [@gaichas2012assembly].

In multi-species and/or multi-area contexts, hierarchical stock assessment 
models, which treat each area/species combination as a discrete yet 
exchangeable replicate, may represent a compromise between single-species 
and data-pooling approaches.  For this paper, we define a 
hierarchical stock assessment model as a model fit to multiple replicates 
(e.g. areas/species) simultaneously, using hierarchical hyper-priors on 
selected parameters to share information between replicates 
[@thorson2015giants]. Hierarchical priors induce shrinkage effects in 
which parameter values are drawn towards an estimated overall mean value,
thus improving model convergence for replicates with low statistical power
data while still estimating replicate-specific parameters based on that 
data. Hierarchical methods based on data and hyper-priors stand in 
contrast to data-pooled methods that estimate a mean value only, or 
single-stock methods that usually rely on strong *a priori* assumptions 
about replicate specific parameters, forcing parameters to be identical 
among replicates, or using strongly informative priors, all of which 
will almost certainly increase assessment bias [@jiao2009hierarchical; 
@jiao2011poor; @punt2011among].

Although hierarchical stock assessments are expected to produce better
estimates of species biomass and productivity than single-species
methods in contexts, it remains unclear whether 
such improved statistical performance translates into better 
management outcomes [@johnson2018evaluating]. Aside from some related 
simulations determining the benefits of manually sharing information 
gained when actively adaptively managing spatially replicated groundfish 
stocks [@collie1991adaptive], to our knowledge there are no evaluations 
of the management performance of hierarchical stock assessment models. 
Further, low assessment model bias and/or high precision, which are
often unattainable outside of simulations, aren't necessary conditions 
for superior management performance, because biases can, in practice, 
sometimes compensate for each other (e.g., negative correlation in stock 
size and productivity), or be offset for by other parts of the management 
system, such as a reduction in harvest rate. A modern fisheries management 
oriented paradigm is more concerned with the expected performance of a 
fisheries management system - made up of data, assessments, and harvest 
rules - despite the inherent, and at some point irreducible, uncertainties
in the system [@de-la-Mare1998Tidier-fisherie].

In this paper, we investigated whether hierarchical stock assessment models 
improved management performance in a simulated multi-species, spatially
replicated fishery. The simulated fishery was modeled on a 
spatially heterogeneous complex of Dover sole (*Microstomus pacificus*), 
English sole (*Parophrys vetulus*), and southern Rock sole 
(*Lepidopsetta bilineata*) off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, 
fished in three spatial management areas. Closed-loop feedback simulation 
was used to estimate fishery outcomes when catch limits were set based 
on estimates of biomass from single-species, data-pooling, and hierarchical
state-space surplus production models under high, moderate, and low data 
quantity scenarios. Assessment models were either fit to species-specific 
data as single-species or hierarchical multi-species models, or fit to 
data pooled spatially across management units, pooled across species 
within a spatial management unit, or totally aggregated across 
both species and spatial management units. Management performance of 
each assessment approach was by both the risk of overfishing, and
by cumulative absolute loss in catch, defined as deviation from optimal 
catch trajectories generated by an omniscient manager, who could set 
annual effort to maximize total multi-species/multi-stock complex yield 
given perfect knowledge of all future recruitments 
[@walters1998evaluation; @martell2008retrospective].
