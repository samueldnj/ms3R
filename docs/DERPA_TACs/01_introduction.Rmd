# Introduction


Managers of multi-species fisheries aim to balance harvest of multiple
interacting target and non-target species that vary in abundance and
productivity. Among-species variation in productivity implies 
variation in single-species optimal harvest rates, and, therefore,
differential responses to exploitation. Single-species optimal harvest 
rates (e.g., the harvest rate associated with maximum sustainable 
yield) typically ignore both multi-species trophic interactions that
influence individual demographic rates [@gislason1999single; 
@collie2001biological], and technical interactions that make it virtually 
impossible to simultaneously achieve the optimal harvest rate for all 
species [@pikitch1987use]. 

Technical interactions among species that co-occur in non-selective 
fishing gear are a defining characteristic of multi-species fisheries 
[@pikitch1987use; @punt2002evaluation] and, therefore, play a central 
role in multi-species fisheries management outcomes for individual 
species [@ono2017management; @kempf2016msy]. Catch limits set 
for individual species without considering technical interactions 
subsequently lead to sub-optimal fishery outcomes [@ono2017management; 
@punt2011calculating; @punt2020multispecies]. For example, under-utilization 
of catch limits could occur when technically interacting quota species are 
caught at different rates (i.e., catchability) by a common gear, leading 
to a choke constraint in which one species quota is filled before the 
others [@baudron2015adverse]. Choke constraints are generally 
considered negative outcomes for multi-species fishery performance, 
because they reduce harvester profitability as increasingly rare quota 
for choke species may limit access to fishing grounds, as well as 
driving quota costs above the landed value of the choke 
species [@mortensen2018identifying].

Setting catch limits for individual species in any fishery usually
requires an estimate of species abundance, which continues to be
a central challenge of fisheries stock assessment 
[@hilborn1992quantitative; @quinn2003ruminations; @maunder2015contemporary], 
especially when species data are insufficient for stock assessment models. Where such data limitations 
exist, data pooling is sometimes used to extend stock assessments to 
complexes of similar, interacting stocks of fish [@appeldoorn1996model]. 
A couple of examples include pooling data for a single species across 
multiple spatial strata when finer scale data are unavailable
or when fish are believed to move between areas at a sufficiently
high rate [@benson2015evaluating; @punt2018estimates], and pooling data 
for multiple species of the same taxonomic group within an area 
when data are insufficient for individual species or during development
of new fisheries [@demartini2019hazards]. Data-pooled estimates of 
productivity represent means across the species complex; therefore the 
general cost of such pooling approaches is that catch limits will tend to 
overfish unproductive species and underfish productive ones 
[@gaichas2012assembly]. Hierarchical stock assessment models may help reduce
these problems by representing a compromise between uninformative 
single-species single-species approaches and problematic data-pooling
approaches. In particular, hierarchical models allow data sharing 
between multiple species within a complex via hierarchical shrinkage 
prior distributions on model parameters that represent biological 
similarities or technical interactions [@thorson2015giants]. Shared priors
shrink species-specific parameters towards an estimated complex level
mean value, improving model convergence for data-poor species and basing 
estimates more on available data than strong *a priori* assumptions like 
fixed (i.e. known) parameters, identical parameters among species, or 
strongly informative priors [@jiao2009hierarchical; @jiao2011poor; 
@punt2011among].

Although hierarchical stock assessments produce better
estimates of species biomass and productivity than single-species
methods in data-limited contexts, it remains unclear whether 
such improved statistical performance translates into better 
management outcomes [@johnson2018evaluating]. On one hand, improving 
assessment model statistical performance may sacrifice future 
fishery benefits of adaptive learning [@walters1986adaptive],
as large assessment errors caused by poor quality data in the
present may generate high contrast data that are more informative
in the future. Alternatively, adaptive learning may fail to occur
in a reasonable time in the presence of large errors, leading
to stock collapse or harvesters divesting from the fishery because
of over- or under-exploitation. Improving the rate of adaptive 
learning may be possible via hierarchical modeling of spatially 
replicated groundfish stocks, because the shared priors take
lessons learned from responses to disturbances in one area 
and use them to improve stock assessments in other areas 
[@collie1991adaptive].

In this paper, we investigated whether hierarchical 
stock assessment models improved management performance
in a simulated multi-species, data-limited fishery. The 
simulated fishery was modeled on a complex of Dover sole, 
English sole, and southern rock sole - three species of 
right-eyed flounders (*Pleuronectidae spp.*) - Dover sole (*Microstomus
pacificus*), English sole (*Parophrys vetulus*), and southern rock
sol (*Lepidopsetta bilineata*) - fished off the 
coast of British Columbia, Canada, in three spatial management areas. 
Closed-loop feedback simulation was used to estimate fishery
outcomes when catch limits were set based on estimates 
of biomass from single-species, data-pooling, and hierarchical
state-space surplus production models under three data scenarios. 
Assessment models were either fit to species specific data as 
single-species or hierarchical multi-species models, or fit to data 
pooled spatially across management units, pooled across species 
within a spatial management unit, or totally aggregated across 
both species and spatial management units. Management performance of 
each assessment approach was measured as cumulative absolute loss in 
catch, measured against optimal catch trajectories generated by an 
omniscient manager, who could set annual effort to maximize total
multi-species/multi-stock complex yield given perfect knowledge of all
future recruitments [@walters1998evaluation; @martell2008retrospective].
