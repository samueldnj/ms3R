# Introduction


Management decisions in multi-species fisheries are often 
made on a species-by-species basis. Single-species management
often ignores the fact that fishing is inherently non-selective,
and therefore in most cases, fishing effort results in the
simultaneous catch of multiple species, which are said to 
have technical interactions [@punt2002evaluation]. Management decisions, 
such as setting total allowable catches (TACs), are often made for
a given species based on the output of species specific
stock assessments, if they even exist. Those single-species 
assessments, at best, are only able to implicity include 
multi-species ecological interactions in the form of 
natural mortality rates and recruitment process errors 
[@albertsen2017connecting], but are completely unable 
to explicitly capture technical interactions. Ignorance 
of technical interactions while setting TACs will 
often lead to sub-optimal fishery outcomes [@ono2017management;
@punt2002evaluation]. For example, under-utilisation of TAC 
could occur when multiple technically interacting quota species 
are caught with very different gear availability (catchability), 
leading to one species quota being filled faster than the others 
and creating a choke point in the management system 
[@baudron2015adverse]. In turn, the under-utilised TACs may 
create uninformative catch data, which can degrade stock assessment 
performance over successive fishing seasons, and may 
create a reinforcing feedback loop that will lead to 
reduced data quality in the long term. If unarrested, 
data quality reducing feedback loops 
would weaken the information linkage required to 
take management actions commensurate with stock status.


Difficulties linking management decisions to stock 
status are compounded when data or management resources 
are limited [@Carruthers2014Evaluating].
Data limitations or low commercial value often preclude 
extending the best management practices (e.g., 
Management Strategy Evaluation) to all species in a multi-species
fishery. Data pooling is often used to extend stock assessments to 
complexes of multiple stocks of similar, interacting species
of fish, where similar may be defined in a biological
sense, or in a sense more related to overlapping management unit 
boundaries [@gaichas2012assembly]. More recently, hierarchical stock 
assessment models are being applied to extend assessments 
in multi-species and multi-stock complexes where better data exists 
for some subgroup of the complex, and there are biological reasons 
to expect biological parameters to be similar among species in
the complex [@thorson2015giants]. For example, 
estimates of management parameters and stock status are improved in 
scenarios where data is of low statistical power (i.e., short 
time series or noisy observations) when hierarchical multi-stock 
surplus production models penalise survey catchability and intrinsic
growth rate by shrinkage priors, compared to single-stock
models fit to the same data [@johnson2018evaluating].

Although hierarchical stock assessments perform better 
on limited data under simulation self-tests than single 
stock methods, it is unclear if hierarchical stock assessment
methods lead to better management outcomes than single-stock
or data-pooled methods. Previous research on stock assessment
and managment procedure performance in multi-stock and multi-species 
fisheries have been focused on mismatches between the spatial 
scales of assessment or management and the true underlying stock
dynamics [@benson2015evaluating; @punt2018estimates], or on the 
comparative performance when considering technical interactions 
between target and non-target (bycatch) species when setting 
catch limits based on independent single-species stock 
assessments [@ono2017management]. Further, research on 
hierarchical stock assessment procedures has been focused 
on assessment bias under different levels of model 
complexity [@punt2011among; @jiao2016integrating;
@jiao2011poor; @jiao2009hierarchical; @johnson2018evaluating].


In this paper, we simulated a spatially structured, 
multi-species flatfish fishery, and tested the performance 
of multiple management procedures that were based on assessment 
methods that often used to deal with data limitations in 
multi-species fisheries. We conditioned our simulated fishery 
on the complex of Dover, English, and Rock soles in British Columbia, 
Canada [*Pleuronectidae spp*]. These three species 
co-occur along the BC coast, are caught 
together in directed trawl fisheries, and are surveyed by 
the same multi-species trawl survey. While time series
of catch and commercial CPUE exist for all species and 
areas since the 1950s, all fishery independent observation 
series are quite noisy and some are very short, making this 
complex a good candidate for data limited stock assessment 
methods. Assessment methods we tested included data-pooling 
across spatial strata, across multiple species within a 
stratum, or total aggregation, as well as hierarchical multi-species 
and multi-stock models that used multi-level shrinkage priors 
to share information on productivity and survey catchability 
parameters among replicates [@johnson2018evaluating]. Procedure 
performance was measured as absolute or relative loss in catch and 
biomass compared to the outcome of simulations where an 
omniscient manager is maximising total system yield 
[@walters1998evaluation]. To include technical interactions 
in our simulated fishery system, we derived a commercial
catchability ratio between fishing effort and mortality
for each species/stock combination, and allowed future
fishing effort to increase until at least one TAC was fully
utilised, which represents a fully integrated output 
control fishery with technical interactions, as is 
the case in British Columbia. Total allowable catches 
were set as constant removal rates based on either 
multi-species optimal harvest rates, derived from 
adding single-species yield curves with respect
to effort [@mueter2006using], or traditional 
single-species optimal harvest rates.
