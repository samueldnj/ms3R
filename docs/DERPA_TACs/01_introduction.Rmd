FROM ABSTRACT

*Management decisions in multi-species fisheries are often made on a single-species
and single-stock basis, with TACs often set by considering the output of 
a single-species stock assessment model. Single-species assessment methods, at best, 
only implicitly include multi-species interactions through natural mortality and 
recruitment process errors, which are not suitable for capturing technical interactions 
between multiple species and fishing gear. Ignorance of technical interactions when 
setting TACs will often lead to sub-optimal fishery outcomes, such as under-utilised TACs from choke
effects in output-controlled fisheries. In turn, these sub-optimal outcomes may
degrade the information linkage between stock-status and management decisions
by lowering the statistical power of catch data, reducing the efficacy
of stock assessment models. These issues are further compounded in situations where 
data or management resources are limited, exemplified by short time-series of 
fishery independent observations or limited biologica data, or the 
structure of the management decision is mismatched to the spatial structure of the system, 
exemplified by aggregating multiple spatial stocks or species into one management unit. In
those situations, assessments may either 
In this paper, we simulate a spatially structured, multi-species flatfish fishery, and

often used to deal with data limitations in multi-species fisheries, including 
data-pooling across spatial strata or across multiple species. Procedure performance
is measured as absolute or relative loss in catch and biomass compared to the outcome

Management decisions in multi-species fisheries are often 
made on a species-by-species basis. Single-species management
often ignores the fact that fishing is inherently non-selective,
and, in most cases, fishing effort intersects multiple 
interacting species. Management decisions, such as setting 
total allowable catches (TACs), are often made for
a given species based on the output of species specific
stock assessments, if they even exist. Those single-species 
assessments, at best, are only able to implicity include 
multi-species ecological interactions in the form of 
natural mortality rates and recruitment process errors 
[@albertsen2017connecting], and are completely unable 
to capture technical interactions between species.

Ignorance of technical interactions while setting TACs will 
often lead to sub-optimal fishery outcomes [@ono2017management;
@punt2002evaluation]. For example, under-utilisation of TAC 
could occur when multiple quota species
are caught in the same fishing effort, creating a choke point
on the management system [@baudron2015adverse]. In turn, 
under-utilised TACs may create uninformative catch data, 
which may further degrade stock assessment performance 
over successive fishing seasons creating a reinforcing
feedback loop that successively reduces data quality. 
If unarrested, such feedback loops would weaken the 
information linkage between management actions and 
stock status.

- Something about bycatch, lower commercial value species,
less data so expensive procedures like MSE are often
left out in the cold.


Data limitations or low commercial value often preclude 
extending the best management practices (closed loop sim, 
aka Management Strategy Evaluation) to all species in a multi-species
fishery. Data pooling is often used to extend assessments to 
complexes of multiple stocks of similar, interacting species
of fish, where similar may be defined in a biological
sense, or in a sens more related to their management 
[@gaichas2012assembly]. More recently, hierarchical stock 
assessment models are being 
applied to extend assessments in multi-species and multi-stock 
complexes where better data exists for some subgroup of the complex, 
and there are biological reasons to expect biological parameters
to be similar among complex members [@thorson2015giants]. For example, 
estimates of management parameters and stock status are improved in 
scenarios where data is of low statistical power (i.e., short 
time series or noisy observations) when hierarchical multi-stock 
surplus production models penalise survey catchability and intrinsic
growth rate by shrinkage priors, compared to single-stock
models fit to the same data [@johnson2018evaluating].

Although hierarchical stock assessments perform better 
on limited data under simulation self-tests than single 
stock methods, it is unclear if hierarchical stock assessment
methods lead to better management outcomes either single-stock
or data-pooled methods. Previous research on managment procedure
performance in multi-stock and multi-species fisheries
has been focused on spatial scale mismatches between
the management procedure and the true underlying stock
dynamics [@benson2015evaluating], or on the comparative 
performance when considering technical interactions 
between target and non-target (bycatch) species 
when setting catch limits based on 
independent single-stock assessments [@ono2017management]. 
Similarly, research on hierarchical stock assessment procedures
has been focused on assessment bias under different
levels of model complexity [@punt2011among; @jiao2016integrating;
@jiao2011poor; @jiao2009hierarchical; @johnson2018evaluating].

In this paper, we evaluate management procedures for setting 
catch limits in a spatially diverse multi-species flatfish fishery. 
We condition our simulated fishery on the complex of 
Dover, English, and Rock soles in British Columbia, 
Canada [*Pleuronectidae spp*]. 
These three species co-occur along the BC coast, are caught 
together in directed trawl fisheries, and are surveyed by 
the same multi-species trawl survey. While time series
of catch and commercial CPUE exist for all species and 
areas since the 1950s, all observation series are quite 
noisy and some are very short, making this complex a 
good candidate for management with a hierarchical stock
assessment model. Our closed loop simulation experiments 
compare the performance of management procedures built 
around single-stock, data-pooled, and hierarchical 
multi-stock assessment models to the outcomes from fishing
effort allocated by an omniscient manager [@walters1998evaluation], 
who wants to maximise average catch subject to 
constraints on catch and effort variability, and stock status.
