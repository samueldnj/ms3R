# Introduction

Management decisions in multi-species fisheries are often 
made on a species-by-species basis. This ignores the fact that
fishing is inherently non-selective and in most fisheries,
fishing effort intersects multiple interacting species.

- Something about bycatch, lower commercial value species,
less data so expensive procedures like MSE are often
left out in the cold.


Data limitations or low commercial value often preclude 
extending the best management practices (closed loop sim, 
aka Management Strategy Evaluation) to all species in a multi-species
fishery. Data pooling is often used to extend assessments to 
complexes of multiple stocks of similar, interacting species
of fish, where similar may be defined in a biological
sense, or in a sens more related to their management 
[@gaichas2012assembly]. More recently, hierarchical stock 
assessment models are being 
applied to extend assessments in multi-species and multi-stock 
complexes where better data exists for some subgroup of the complex, 
and there are biological reasons to expect biological parameters
to be similar among complex members [@thorson2015giants]. For example, 
estimates of management parameters and stock status are improved in 
scenarios where data is of low statistical power (i.e., short 
time series or noisy observations) when hierarchical multi-stock 
surplus production models penalise survey catchability and intrinsic
growth rate by shrinkage priors, compared to single-stock
models fit to the same data [@johnson2018evaluating].

Although hierarchical stock assessments perform better 
on limited data under simulation self-tests than single 
stock methods, it is unclear if hierarchical stock assessment
methods lead to better management outcomes either single-stock
or data-pooled methods. Previous research on managment procedure
performance in multi-stock and multi-species fisheries
has been focused on spatial scale mismatches between
the management procedure and the true underlying stock
dynamics [@benson2015evaluating], or on the comparative 
performance when considering technical interactions 
between target and non-target (bycatch) species 
when setting catch limits based on 
independent single-stock assessments [@ono2017management]. 
Similarly, research on hierarchical stock assessment procedures
has been focused on assessment bias under different
levels of model complexity [@punt2011among; @jiao2016integrating;
@jiao2011poor; @jiao2009hierarchical; @johnson2018evaluating].  

In this paper, we use closed loop simulation to evaluate 
procedures for setting catch limits in a spatially diverse 
multi-species flatfish fishery. We condition our simulated
fishery on the complex of Dover, English, and Rock 
soles in British Columbia, Canada [*Pleuronectidae spp*]. 
These three species co-occur along the BC coast, are caught 
together in directed trawl fisheries, and are surveyed by 
the same multi-species trawl survey. While time series
of catch and commercial CPUE exist for all species and 
areas since the 1950s, fisher, biological data is limited for 
many species/area combinations.
