## Omniscient manager simulations and multispecies equilibria

We found that the median biomass of each species 
under the omniscient manager was close to the equilibrium 
biomass associated with the multispecies maximum 
sustainable yield in each area [figure]. In each area, as 
predicted by the equilibrium calculations, the optimal effort 
for the complex results in overfishing of the Dover sole
stocks.

Despite the tendency of the manager to increase fishing
mortality rates to above the single species $F_{MSY}$
for all Dover sole stocks, very few simulations actually push 
Dover sole into an overfished state. For all stocks of all 
species, the probability of being below 40% of single species
$B_{MSY}$ is at most 1% (TABLE), while probability of being
above 80% of $B_{MSY}$ is at least 54%. 

Tendency to reduce effort to very low in first few years
for some replicates, despite penalty in objective 
function -- check sims??
