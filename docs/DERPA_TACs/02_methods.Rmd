# Methods

## British Columbia's flatfish fishery


## Simulation model framework

Our simulation framework has an operating
model component, and management procedure components. The
stochastic operating model simulates the responses of a 
spatially complex multispecies fish populations to
trawl fishing effort. Fishing effort is allocated among
areas according to a simplifed Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) 
model in response to TACs set by the management procedure
component, with the attractiveness of an area based on the relative 
historical fishing effort, relative price of each species, 
and catch rates from the previous fishing season. A key 
feature of our effort allocation method
is that a declining utility is assiged to the utilisation
of the TAC, as if quota is completely filled then fishing for 
all species must stop for the season.

The operating model (OM) component is a multi-species,
multi-stock age- and sex-structured population dynamics model 
(Appendix A). We conditioned the OM by fitting it as 
a stock assessment model to commercial and survey data
for the DER complex, including commercial catch, CPUE,
and catch-at-age/length and relative survey biomass,
and survey catch-at-age/length. Given the low volume
of biological data from recent time periods, we applied 
a hierarchical multi-species and multi-stock
formulation with shrinkage priors on natural mortality,
stock-recruitment steepness, and trawl survey 
catchability. We refer readers to Appendix A for 
full details.

Closed loop simulations apply the management procedure
iteratively in the following N steps over the T years 
of the projection:

1. Use an assessment method to determine stock
status of the complex, either using data pooling,
hierarchical assessments, or single-stock assessments; 
2. Apply a harvest control rule to determine
total allowable catch, and then allocate TAC 
among species if using a data-pooling method;
3. Allocate effort to maximise profits
according to effort allocation model;
4. Generate realised catches from effort with
updated catch rates;
5. Update stochastic population dynamics and
generate new observation data.

Each set of $T$ projection years was repeated
100 times to integrate over observation errors 
and recruitment process errors.

### Surplus production stock assessment models

Management procedures determined stock
status using a flexible process-error surplus 
production model. The flexibility allowed the
same model to be used for all assessment complex
configurations, ranging from data-pooled single
stock assessments with no shrinkage priors, to hierarchical
multi-species and multi-stock assessments. We defined this
model in Template Model Builder, extending
a model from our previous research [@kristensen2015tmb;
@johnson2018evaluating]. For hierarchical model formulations, 
we applied shrinkage priors to survey catchability 
and intrinsic growth rate (Appendix B).

9 in total, spanning 3 dimensions

dim1: pooled <-> hierarchical <-> separated
dim2: single species <-> multi-species
dim3: spatial <-> coastwide


1. Coastwide (1 stock)
    a. Pooled
    b. Hierarchical multispecies
    c. single-species
2. Spatial (by stock area - 3 stocks)
    a. Pooled w/in area      
    b. Single species w/in area.
    c. Hierarchical multi-species w/in area
    d. Hierarchical multi-stock across areas, w/in species
3. Fully spatial (nS * 3 stocks)
    a. Hierarchical multi-species multi-stock
    b. Single stock

Data is pooled by simple summation of both
catch and biomass indices across species within
each area. This reflects that each species' survey 
biomass index is an estimate of trawlable biomass, 
so the pooled index is an estimate of trawlable
complex biomass available to the survey. For coastwide
assessments, each survey (pooled or separate) is
considered as a separate index of the same population.

Each time step $t$, the AM estimates production model 
equilibria $B_{MSY}$ and $U_{MSY}$, and an expected 
biomass estimate $\hat{B}_{t+1}$ for the following 
time step.


### Harvest control rule

To set catch limits for a given stock, or data-pooled complex,
we applied a simple ramped precuationary harvest control 
rule, following Canadian federal policy [@DFO2006A-Harvest-Strat]:
\begin{equation}
U_{t+1} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
            0 & \hat{B}_{t+1} \leq .4\hat{B}_{MSY} \\
            \frac{\hat{B}_{t+1} - .4\hat{B}_{MSY}}{(.6 - .4)\hat{B}_{MSY}} U_{MSY} & 
                .4 < \hat{B}_{t+1}/\hat{B}_{MSY} \leq .6 \\
            \hat{U}_{MSY} & \hat{B}_{t+1} \geq .6\hat{B}_{MSY}
          \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
Where $\hat{B}_{MSY}$, $\hat{U}_{MSY}$, and $\hat{B}_{t+1}$  
were estimated by the assessment model either for 
a individual species or stocks, or a data-pooled complex.

Total allowable catch (TAC) was then set as the product
of target harvest rate and projected biomass
\begin{equation}
TAC_{t+1} = U_{t+1} \cdot \hat{B}_{t+1}.
\end{equation}
In situations where the assessment model scale matched
the operating model scale, then TACs were passed directly
to the effort allocation model. In other cases when data were
pooled or stock structure was ignored, we defined rules
for allocating TAC among areas and species.

For coastwide assessments all three stock
area survey series were used, so TAC was apportioned 
according to the relative survey catchability estimated
by the assessment model, i.e.
\begin{equation}
TAC_{p,t+1} = \frac{\hat{q}_p}{ \sum_{p'} \hat{q}_{p'} } TAC_{t+1}. 
\end{equation}
This reflects the assumption that survey indices
are relative, or minimum, trawlable biomass estimates,
and catchability coefficients are then an indicator
of the proportion of total coastwide biomass available 
to the survey in each area. We normalise by the total
catchability coefficient as we do not expect
that they will sum to 1, indicating that some fish 
remain invulnerable to the survey, either by being 
higher in the water column, or in non-trawlable habitat.

For splitting TAC within an area when data has been pooled,
we split them according to the relative contribution of each
species to the pooled data. For example, if the pooled biomass 
index for stock area $p$ in time step $t$ was the sum of species
specific indices in the same area, i.e,
\begin{equation}
I_{p,t} = \sum_s I_{s,p,t},
\end{equation}
then the TAC for species $s$ is simply
\[
TAC_{s,p,t+1} = \frac{I_{s,p,t}}{I_{p,t}} TAC_{p,t+1}.
\]


### Fishing effort allocation and fishing mortality

We allocated fishing effort according to an
ideal free distribution model, which allocated 
effort to maximise expected revenue 
from each area. The expected revenue for each
area was computed as the sum of the expected catch 
times the relative value of each species, modulated 
by a utility function for species catch that became 
negative as the catch of that species approached the 
total allowable catch in that area.

For species $s$ in stock area $p$ at time $t$, we 
determined expected catch $\hat{C}_{s,p,t}$ as a 
function of effort $E_{p,t}$ using a simplifed
Baranov equation
\begin{align}
\hat{C}_{s,p,t} &= (1 - e^{E_{p,t} \cdot \hat{q}_{p,t-1}}) \cdot \hat{B}_{s,p,t}.
\end{align}
We then calculated the utility $U_{s,p,t}$ for the
expected catch of species $s$ that resulted from
effort $E_{p,t}$. Finally, we found the
expected revenue $\bar{R}_{p,t}$ as the sum
of the expected revenues for each species,
when modified by the utility function.
\begin{align}
U_{s,p,t}(E_{p,t}) &= \frac{5 \cdot \frac{\hat{C}_{s,p,t}}{TAC_{s,p,t}} - 1}{4 \cdot \frac{\hat{C}_{s,p,t}}{TAC_{s,p,t}}} \\
\bar{R}_{p,t} & = \sum_{s} \hat{C}_{s,p,t} \cdot P_s \cdot U_{s,p,t}(E_{p,t}).
\end{align}

This form of expected revenue is meant to represent
the response of quota trading to scarcity of species
quota under the ITQ managment system. As catch approaches
the available quota, quota becomes scarce and the cost of 
obtaining more quota increases, as that quota's value
reflects not only the landed value of the species, but
the value of access to fishing grounds that it grants. This
often exceeds the landed value of the fish, and therefore
creates a negative utility in exhausting the available
quota. 

**SDNJ** Need to add little optimisation method to 
allocate a fixed level of effort among the areas, 
based on expected revenue and the relative costs
of fishing in an area, probably based on the 
historical effort allocation and GFE price.

Effort was then supplied to the operating model to
generate realised fishing mortality among
species and stock areas. Given the lag
in the catch rates used to generate the 
effort allocation, there is a small chance
that the effort applied in an area will
exhaust the quota. In these cases, fishing
was allowed to continue until the catch
reached 130% of the TAC for that species/stock
combination, after which all effort
was terminated in that stock area. The
overage in realised catch over
the the TAC was then deducted from
the following year's TAC. **ADD underfulfillment
as well?**

## Simulation experiments and performance

We ran a total of $N$ simulations, made up of
fully factorial combinations of $J$ OM scenarios
and 9 management procedures. We ran each OM/MP 
combination as 100 replicates, each initialised
with a unique random seed, thereby integrating 
over all stochastic processes. To eliminate the
effect of random variation between simulations, 
each simulation was initialised with the same set
of 100 random seeds.

### OM scenarios

Based on effort allocation model? Not a source
of management control, and really a source of
uncertainty for the system as it's user defined.
Not really the question here, tho. 

Maybe just increased/decreased
data availability - this is really

Data scenarios:
1. Surveys only
2. Commercial CPUE and surveys for historical period - can't
really pool commercial CPUE in the same way...

Survey CV scenarios:
1. current CV
2. Half current CV
3. Twice current CV

Effort model scenarios - maybe a different paper on
sustainable overfishing, as this would be a major
source of uncertainty in the OM:
1. White noise in catch rates
2. Red noise in catch rates
3. Correlations in catch rates among stocks/species

### Management procedures

We tested nine MPs corresponding to the nine assessment 
model configurations outlined above. We chose to restrict
ourselves to the AM configuration only, as this would
allow us to focus on the management performance
of the range of models under different data quality 
scenarios, rather than the interaction between the
assessment model and other management procedure components.

### Performance metrics

Given that no set of formal management objectives exists
for the BC flatfish fishery, we decided to generic
conservation metrics to evaluate the
conservation performance of our management procedures
(metrics 1 - 3 below). In addition to the standard 
average catch and annual average variation (metrics 4
and 5), we also defined quota utilisation
and average revenue metrics for evaluating the
MPs from a commercial point of view.

1. $P(B_{s,p,t} < .4B_{MSY,s,p})$: the probability of 
biomass falling below the generally accepted limit 
reference point of 40% of $B_{MSY}$;
2. $P(B_{s,p,t} < .8B_{MSY,s,p})$: the probability that
a stock is in an overfished state;
3. $P(U_{s,p,t} > U_{MSY,s,p})$: the probability that
overfishing occured;
4. $\bar{C}_{s,p,t}$: average catch;
5. $AAV_{s,p}$: the average annual variation in catch
\begin{equation*}
AAV_{s,p} = \frac{\sum_t |C_{s,p,t} - C_{s,p,t+1} | }{\sum_t C_{s,p,t}}.
\end{equation*}
6. $C_{s,p,t} / TAC_{s,p,t}$: quota utilisation ratios?
7. $R_{s,p,t}$: average revenue?

All metrics are calculated
over the first $K$ years of the projection
period.
