# Methods

## British Columbia's flatfish fishery

British Columbia's multi-species complex of right-eyed flounders is 
a technically interacting group of flatfishes managed across the whole
BC coast. Although there are several right-eyed flounders in BC waters, 
we focus on Dover sole, English sole, and Rock sole. Taken together, 
these species comprise a multi-stock complex (DER complex), managed 
as part of the BC multi-species groundfish fishery.

The DER complex is managed in three spatially distinct stock
areas (Figure 1) [@PRIFMP2015]. From north to south, the first 
stock area - Hecate Strait/Haida Gwaii (HSHG) - corresponds to
BC groundfish management area 5CDE, extending from 
Dixon Entrance and north of Haida Gwaii, south through 
Hecate Strait. The second stock area - Queen Charlotte Sound 
(QCS) - corresponds to BC groundfish management area 5AB, 
extending from the southern tip of Haida Gwaii to the northern
tip of Vancouver Island. Finally, the third area - West Coast of 
Vancouver Island (WCVI) - corresponds to groundfish management 
area 3CD, extending from the northern tip of Vancouver Island 
south to Juan de Fuca Strait.

Each area had two commercial catch rate series and at least one 
survey biomass index time series for each species (Table 1). 
The two commercial fishery catch-per-unit-effort series span 
1976 - 2016, split between a historical trawl fishery 
(1976 - 1995) and a modern trawl fishery (1996 - 2016), 
with the split corresponding to pre- and post-implementation of an 
at-sea-observer program, respectively. The fishery independent trawl 
survey biomass indices were the biennial Hecate Strait Assemblage 
survey in the HSHG area (1984 - 2002), and the Groundfish Multi-species 
Synoptic Survey, with separate biennial legs in all three stock 
areas (2003 - 2016).


## Closed-loop feedback simulation framework

Closed-loop simulation is often used to evaluate proposed
feedback management systems. In fisheries, closed-loop simulation evaluates 
fishery management system components, such as stock assessment models or 
harvest decision rules, by simulating repeated applications of these
components, along with propagating realistic errors in monitoring data, 
stock assessment model outputs, and harvest advice 
[@de-la-Mare1998Tidier-fisherie; @cox2008practical; @cox2013roles]. At the 
end of the simulation, pred-defined performance metrics are used to
determine the relative performance of the system components being tested. 

Our closed-loop simulation framework included a stochastic operating,
representing the stock and fishery dynamics, as well as an observation
model, and an assessment model component that estimated stock biomass
from simulated observations and fishery catches. The
operating model simulated population dynamics of a spatially 
stratified, multi-species flatfish complex in response to a 
multi-species trawl fishery in each of the three stock areas. 
Although total fishing effort was not restricted across the 
entire area, effort in each individual area was allocated 
such that no species-/area-specific catch exceeded the 
species-/area-specific total allowable catch (TAC). Within an area, 
fishing effort was allowed to increase until at least one 
species-/area-specific TAC was fully caught.

The simulation projected population dynamics for all nine stocks 
forward in time for $32$ years, with annual 
simulated assessments, harvest decisions, and catch removed from 
the population from 2017 - 2048. The following four steps summarise 
the closed-loop simulation procedure for each projection year $t$:

1. Update stochastic population dynamics and
generate new realized catch $C_{s,p,t}(E_{p,t})$ in each
area from effort (eq \ref{eq:FqE});
2. Generate new observation data $I_{s,p,f,t}$ 
(eqs \ref{eq:startIdx}-\ref{eq:endIdx})
3. Apply an assessment model (defined below) to estimate the
spawning biomass for the upcoming year $\hat{B}_{s,p,t+1}$
(eq \ref{eq:amBio});
4. Apply a harvest rate to generate a total allowable catch 
$TAC_{s,p,t+1}$ (eqs \ref{eq:startHR} - \ref{eq:endHR});
5. Allocate effort $E_{p,t+1}$ to fully realise at least
one TAC in each stock area (eq \ref{eq:maxE}).


### Operating Model

The operating model (OM) was a multi-species, multi-stock age- 
and sex-structured population dynamics model (Appendix A). 
Population life-history parameters for the operating
model were estimated by fitting a hierarchical age- and 
sex-structured model to data from the real DER complex 
(Johnson, Cox and Knowler, in Prep).

Fishing mortality for individual stocks was scaled to
commercial trawl effort via species-specific catchability
parameters, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
F_{s,p,t} = q^{F}_{s,p} \cdot E_{p,t},\label{eq:FqE}
\end{equation}
where $F_{s,p,t}$ is the fishing mortality rate applied 
to species $s$ in stock-area $p$ by fleet $f$ in year 
$t$, and $q^{F}_{s,p}$ is the commercial catchability 
coefficient scaling trawl effort $E_{p,t}$ in area $p$ 
to fishing mortality (Table 2) [Johnson and Cox, in prep].

The above effort model implies a multi-species maximum yield for 
the trawl fishery in each area, depending on individual species 
productivity, commercial trawl catchability, and relative 
catchabilities among species in the area [@pikitch1987use; 
@punt2011calculating], i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
MSY_{MS,p} = \max_{E} Y_{MS} 
    \left( E, q^{F}_{1,p}, q^{F}_{2,p}, q^{F}_{3,p}, Q_p \right),
\end{equation*}
where $E$ is the total commercial trawl fishing effort, $q_{s,p}$ 
is the commerical trawl catchability coefficient scaling fishing 
effort to fishing mortality for species $s$ 
in area $p$, and $Q_p$ is the set of life-history parameters for 
all DER complex species in area $p$. The function $Y_{MS}$ is the 
total multi-species yield in area $p$ as a function of fishing 
effort $E_p$ (Figure 2, heavy black lines), defined as the sum of 
species-specific equilibrium yields
\begin{equation*}
Y_{MS,p} \left(E_p, q^{F}_{1,p}, q^{F}_{2,p}, q^{F}_{3,p}, Q_p \right)
 = \sum^3_{s=1} Y_{SS,s,p} (E_p, q_{s,p}, Q_{s,p} ),
\end{equation*}
where $Q_{s,p}$ is the subset of $Q_p$ containing life history 
parameters for species $s$ in area $p$, and the function $Y_{SS,s,p}$ 
is the traditional single-species yield curve expressed as a 
function of effort rather than fishing mortality (Figure 2, 
coloured lines).

The level of fishing effort producing multi-species maximum 
yield $MSY_{MS,p}$ in area $p$ is defined as 
\begin{equation*}
E_{MSY,p} = {\argmax}_{E} Y_{MS} 
    \left( E, q^{F}_{1,p}, q^{F}_{2,p}, q^{F}_{3,p}, Q_p \right),
\end{equation*}
with arguments defined above (Figure 2, vertical dashed line). 
The fishing effort level $E_{MSY,p}$ has an associated equilibrium 
biomass $B_{MSY,MS,s,p}$ and yield 
\begin{equation*}
MSY_{MS,s,p} = Y_{SS,s,p} (E_{MSY,p}, q^{F}_{s,p}, Q_{s,p} )
\end{equation*}
for each species $s$ (Figure 2, three lower horizontal dashed 
lines showing individual species yield), which differ from the 
single-species $B_{MSY}$ and $MSY$ when commercial catchability 
scalars differ between species.

For simulated fishing in the projection time period, we allocated 
maximum fishing effort to each area, defined as the effort required 
to fully utilize the TAC of at least one species, while never 
exceeding the TAC of any one of the three species, i.e.,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:maxE}
E_{p,t+1} = \max \{ E ~|~ C_{s,p,t+1}(E) \leq TAC_{s,p,t+1} \forall s \},
\end{equation}
where $C_{s,p,t+1}(E)$ is the catch of species $s$ when effort $E$ 
is applied in area $p$ in year $t+1$ (the method for determining 
TACs is explained below). We used maximum effort instead of an 
explicit effort dynamics model because the former was adequate for 
understanding the relative management performance of the assessment 
models that we tested. Furthermore, the maximum effort model may be 
simplified over reality, but it did an adequate job of capturing
choke effects observed in the real BC groundfish fishery system.


### Surplus production stock assessment models

At each time step $t$, simulated annual assessments were used to 
estimate the expected future spawning biomass estimate $\hat{B}_{t+1}$ 
via a state-space Schaefer production model [@schaefer1957some; 
@punt2002evaluation], modified to better approximate the 
biomass-yield relationship underlying the age-/sex-structured 
operating model [@pella1969generalized; @winker2018jabba].
We extended the @johnson2018evaluating hierarchical state-space 
model to fit a multi-species, spatially stratified complex,
as well as fit a single-stock model to data from individual 
or data-pooled stocks, via the biomass equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:amBio}
B_{s,p,t+1} = \left[ B_{s,p,t} + U_{MSY,s,p} \cdot \frac{m_{s,p}}{m_{s,p}-1} 
                  \cdot B_{s,p,t} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{m_{s,p}} \cdot \left( \frac{B_{s,p,t}}{B_{MSY,s,p}} \right)^{m_{s,p} - 1}\right) - C_{s,p,t}\right] e^{\zeta_{s,p,t}},
\end{equation}
where $B_{MSY}$ (optimal biomass) and $U_{MSY}$ (optimal harvest 
rate) are the leading biological model parameters, $m_{s,p}$
is the Pella-Tomlinson parameter controlling skew in the
biomass/yield relationship (derived from operating
model yield curve), and $\zeta_{s,p,t}$ are annual 
process error deviations. 

In total, we defined the following five potential assessment 
model configurations:

1. Total Aggregation (1 stock);
2. Species Pooling (3 stocks, independent);
3. Spatial Pooling (3 species, independent);
4. Single-stock (9 stocks, independent);
5. Hierarchical Multi-stock (9 stocks, sharing information);

\noindent where the number of management units is shown in 
parentheses (delete subscripts in eq. 7 for species or stock-area as 
appropriate, e.g., Spatial Pooling models have no $p$ subscript). 

Prior distributions on optimal biomass $B_{MSY,s,p}$, optimal 
harvest rate $U_{MSY,s,p}$, catchability $q_{s,p,f}$, and
process error deviations $\zeta_{s,p,t}$ were defined for each 
assessment model (Table 3). For all non-hierarchical models, prior mean values 
were derived from the operating model biomass/yield relationship, 
with prior mean $B_{MSY}$ values
\begin{align*}
\mu_{B_{MSY,s,p}} &=  B_{MSY,s,p}, \\
\mu_{B_{MSY,s}}   &= \sum_{p} B_{MSY,s,p}, \\
\mu_{B_{MSY,p}}   &= \sum_{s} B_{MSY,s,p}, \\
\mu_{B_{MSY}}     &= \sum_{s,p} B_{MSY,s,p},
\end{align*}
for single-stock, spatial pooled, species pooled, and totally aggregated 
configurations, where $B_{MSY,s,p}$ is the equilibrium biomass at which 
single-species maximum yield is achieved. Similarly, log-normal prior 
mean $\log U_{MSY}$ values were given by
\begin{align*}
\mu_{\log U_{MSY,s,p}} &= \log (MSY_{s,p} / B_{MSY,s,p}), \\
\mu_{\log U_{MSY,s}}   &= \log( \sum_{p} MSY_{s,p} / \sum_{p} B_{MSY,s,p} ), \\
\mu_{\log U_{MSY,p}}   &= \log( \sum_{s} MSY_{s,p} / \sum_{s} B_{MSY,s,p}), \\
\mu_{\log U_{MSY}}     &= \log( \sum_{s,p} MSY_{s,p} / \sum_{s,p} B_{MSY,s,p}),
\end{align*}
for single-stock, spatial-pooled, species-pooled, and totally aggregated 
configurations, respectively, where $MSY_{s,p}$ is the single-species 
maximum yield. Log-normal survey biomass and commercial CPUE catchability 
had prior means set to OM values for the single-stock model, and prior means 
that were averaged OM values over the sources of pooled data under the 
data-pooled models. Prior standard deviations for catchability were set to
$s_f = 1.0$ for commercial CPUE indices in all models, $s_f = 1.0$ for survey 
biomass indices in data-pooled models, and $s_f = 0.5$ for survey indices 
in the single-stock model. Finally, process error prior standard deviations
were fixed at $0.05$ for all stocks, species, and model configurations.

The hierarchical multi-stock model and the single-stock model
used the same priors for $B_{MSY}$ and catchability
for the commercial CPUE and Hecate Strait Assemblage
survey biomass indices. Log-normal hierarchical shrinkage 
priors were applied to area-specific Synoptic survey catchabilities 
$q_{s,p,f}$ within each species, and in two levels to $U_{MSY,s,p}$ 
(as a proxy for intrinsic growth rates) across the whole complex.
Both hierarchical prior distributions had fixed standard
deviation parameters $\sigma_{U_{MSY}} = \tau_q = 0.05$
for differences between stocks within a species for 
catchability $q_{s,p,f}$ and $U_{MSY}$, and the same
standard deviation for the log-normal prior on species average 
$\overline{U}_{MSY,s}$ values. Hierarchical species mean 
catchability for the Synoptic survey $\overline{q}_{s,f}$ 
had a log-normal hyperprior with mean $m_{\log q_{s,f}}$ and 
standard deviation $s_f = .5$, and DER complex mean
$\overline{U}_{MSY}$ had a log-normal hyperprior with 
mean $m_{\log U_{MSY}}$ and standard devation of
$s_{U_{MSY}} = .4$.


### Data generation for assessment models

Time series of catch and biomass indices were simulated in 
the historical and projection periods for fitting assessment 
models. Simulated data matched the time periods of the real
DER complex biomass index data sources, with the exception of 
the Synoptic trawl survey, which was also simulated in the projection, 
period (Table 1). Observation error precision for each data source
is given in Table A.1 (Appendix A).

Biomass indices for individual stocks depended on the nature of 
the index. Assemblage and Synoptic Survey biomass indices were 
defined as trawlable biomass
\begin{equation}\label{eq:startIdx}
\bar{I}_{s,p,f,t} = q_{s,p,f} \cdot B_{s,p,f,t},
\end{equation}
where $\bar{I}_{s,p,f,t}$ is the index without observation error,
$q_{s,p,f}$ is the survey trawl efficiency for species $s$ 
and stock-area $p$, and $B_{s,p,f,t}$ is the biomass of 
species $s$ in stock-area $p$ vulnerable to survey $f$ in 
year $t$. Commercial CPUE indices were defined as
\begin{equation}
\bar{I}_{s,p,f,t} = \frac{C_{s,p,f,t}}{E_{p,f,t}},
\end{equation}
where $C_{s,p,f,t}$ was commercial catch by fleet $f$ of 
species $s$ from area $p$ at time $t$, and $E_{p,f,t}$ was 
commercial fishing effort in area $p$ from fleet $f$ at
time $t$, with both catch and effort required to be positive. 

The method for generating pooled catch and biomass index data depended on 
the data type. Catch data were pooled by summation, and the index data were 
pooled according to the stock-specific definition above. For Assemblage 
and Synoptic survey biomass indices, pooled indices without 
observation error were defined as
\begin{align} 
\bar{I}^{pooled}_{s,f,t}  & = \sum_{p} \mathcal{I}(I_{s,p,f,t} > 0) \cdot q_{s,p,f} \cdot B_{s,p,f,t} \\
\bar{I}^{pooled}_{p,f,t}  & = \sum_{s} \mathcal{I}(I_{s,p,f,t} > 0) \cdot q_{s,p,f} \cdot B_{s,p,f,t} \\
\bar{I}^{pooled}_{f,t}    & = \sum_{s,p} \mathcal{I}(I_{s,p,f,t} > 0) \cdot q_{s,p,f} \cdot B_{s,p,f,t}
\end{align}
where $\bar{I}^{pooled}_{s,f,t}$ is the spatially pooled index for species
$s$, $\bar{I}^{pooled}_{p,f,t}$ is a species pooled index for area $p$, 
$\bar{I}^{pooled}_{f,t}$ is the totally aggregated index (all without
error), and $\mathcal{I}(I_{s,p,f,t} > 0)$ is the indicator function that 
takes value $1$ when survey leg for fleet $f$ in area $p$ was running in 
year $t$. Pooled commercial CPUE indices were simulated as
\begin{align} 
\bar{I}^{pooled}_{s,f,t}  & = \frac{\sum_{p} C_{s,p,f,t}}{\sum_{p} E_{p,f,t} } \\
\bar{I}^{pooled}_{p,f,t}  & = \frac{\sum_{s} C_{s,p,f,t}}{ E_{p,f,t} } \\
\bar{I}^{pooled}_{f,t}    & = \frac{\sum_{s,p} C_{s,p,f,t}}{ \sum_{p} E_{p,f,t} } \label{eq:endIdx}
\end{align}
where $C_{s,p,f,t}$ is catch, and $E_{p,f,t}$ is commercial trawl 
effort, with subscripts as defined above.

### Target harvest rates and total allowable catch

Simulated harvest decision rules applied a constant target harvest 
rate to generate TACs from one-year ahead biomass forecasts obtained
from each assessment model, i.e.,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:startHR}
TAC'_{s,p,t+1} =  U_{s,p} \cdot \hat{B}_{s,p,t+1},
\end{equation}
where $U_{s,p}$ is the target harvest rate for species $s$ in 
stock-area $p$, and $\hat{B}_{s,p,t+1}$ is the year $t+1$ biomass forecast 
from the assessment model. Target harvest rates were derived 
from the multi-species maximum yield relationship via
\begin{equation}
U_{s,p} = \frac{MSY_{MS,s,p}}{B_{MSY,MS,s,p}},
\end{equation}
where $MSY_{MS,s,p}$ and $B_{MSY,MS,s,p}$ are 
the yield and spawning biomass, respectively, 
associated with $E_{MSY,MS,p}$ for species $s$
in area $p$. 

Finally, inter-annual increases in TAC were limited to 20\% for all 
individual stocks as a practical precautionary measure, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
TAC_{s,p,t+1} = \min \{ TAC'_{s,p,t+1},1.2 * TAC_{s,p,t}\},
\end{equation}
where $TAC'_{s,p,t+1}$ is the proposed TAC determined above, and
$TAC_{s,p,t}$ is the previous year's TAC. The limited increase 
reduces overfishing as a result of optimistic assessment errors, 
potentially requiring several years of increases to realise target 
harvest rates as set by assessment model estimates. Conversely, no 
limit was applied to TAC reductions, so that steep declines in biomass 
forecasts would lead to steep declines in catch. Note that this
constraint on inter-annual TAC changes is reflected as a constraint
on inter-annual changes in effort in the objective function used in
omniscient manager solutions described below. 

Pooled TACs were set analogously to the stock-specific case above, with 
pooled target harvest rates applied to biomass projections from pooled 
assessments. For a spatially pooled assessment of species $s$, we defined 
the spatially pooled target harvest rate as
\begin{equation}
U_{s} = \frac{\sum_p MSY_{MS,s,p}}{\sum_p B_{MSY,MS,s,p}},
\end{equation}
where the notation is as defined above. Species pooled harvest rates and 
total aggregation harvest rates were defined analogously.

Pooled TACs were split within an area or across spatial strata proportional 
to Synoptic trawl survey indices for the individual stocks. For example, if 
the TAC for area $p$ is set by a species pooled assessment, then the 
proposed TAC for species $s$ is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:endHR}
TAC'_{s,p,t+1} = \frac{\bar{I}_{s,p,2}}{\sum_{s'} \bar{I}_{s',p,2}} TAC_{p,t+1},
\end{equation}
where $\bar{I}_{s,p,2}$ is the 2-year running average of individual biomass 
indices from the Synoptic survey for species $s$ in area $p$. The 2-year 
average is used because the synoptic survey alternates the legs each 
year, so some individual stock indices are missing.

## Simulation experiments and performance

We ran a total of $15$ simulation experiments comprising five assessment 
models and three data quality scenarios. Simulations integrated over the 
stochastic processess by running at least 100 random replicates of each 
combination, where each simulation was initialized with the same set of 
random seeds to eliminate random effects among combinations
of assessments and data scenarios. Simulations stopped when they either 
reached 100 replicates where simulated assessment models converged in at least 95\% of 
projection time steps for all stocks, or when 140 random replicates were 
attempted. We defined convergence as a positive definite Hessian matrix
and a maximum gradient component less than $10^{-3}$ in absolute value.
A lower threshold of 95\% convergence was chosen given that fitting models 
becomes more difficult as data quality is deliberately reduced, and a 
simulated assessment can not always be tuned like a real assessment 
performed by a real-life analyst. Any OM/assessment model/stock combinations that could 
not reach 100 replicates meeting the 95\% convergence criterion over a 
total of 140 attempts (approximately a 70\% success rate) were considered 
non-significant and were indicated as such in the results. The operating 
model was run for two Dover sole generations [32 years; @seber1997estimation],
because this species had the longest generation time.

Operating model population dynamics and index data were 
identical among replicates for each stock during the operating 
model historical period, except for the last few 
years near the end, where the operating model simulates
recruitment process errors because the conditioning assessment 
was unable to estimate them. Simulated log-normal observation 
and process errors in the projection were randomly drawn with 
the same standard deviations as the errors used in the historical
period, and bias corrected so that asymptotic medians 
matched their expected values, i.e.,
\begin{align}
I_{s,p,f,t} &= \bar{I}_{s,p,f,t} \cdot \exp( \tau_{s,p,f} \cdot \delta_{s,p,f,t} - 0.5\tau^2_{s,p,f} ) \\
R_{s,p,t}   &= \overline{R}_{s,p,t} \cdot \exp( \sigma_{s,p} \cdot \epsilon_{s,p,t} - 0.5\sigma^2_{s,p} ) 
\end{align}
where $\bar{I}_{s,p,f,t}$ is the index without error defined
above, $\tau_{s,p,f}$ is the log-normal observation error standard 
deviation, $\delta_{s,p,f,t}$ is the annual standard normal observation 
error residual, $\overline{R}_{s,p,t}$ is the equilibrium recruitment from 
the Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment curve, $\sigma_{s,p}$ is the recruitment
process error standard deviation, $\epsilon_{s,p,t}$ is the annual standard 
normal recruitment process error, and subscripts $s,p,f,t$ are for species, 
stock, fleet and year, respectively. Error is added to biomass indices
for pooled data independently of the error added to individual indices, i.e.,
\begin{align}
I_{s,f,t} &= \bar{I}_{s,f,t} \cdot \exp( \tau_{s,f} \cdot \delta_{s,f,t} - 0.5\tau^2_{s,f} ) \\
I_{p,f,t} &= \bar{I}_{p,f,t} \cdot \exp( \tau_{p,f} \cdot \delta_{p,f,t} - 0.5\tau^2_{p,f} ) \\
I_{f,t} &= \bar{I}_{f,t} \cdot \exp( \tau_{f} \cdot \delta_{f,t} - 0.5\tau^2_{f} ) 
\end{align}
where $\tau_{s,f}, \tau_{p,f}, \tau_f$ were averaged over the components
of the pooled index.



### Operating model data quality scenarios

The three data quality scenarios range from relatively data-rich to 
data-poor by successively removing commercial CPUE index series from the 
full set, i.e.,

1. Data-**Rich**: Historical CPUE, Modern CPUE, Assemblage 
survey, Synoptic survey;
2. Data-**Mod**erate: Modern CPUE, Assemblage survey, Synoptic survey;
4. Data-**Poor**: Assemblage survey, Synoptic survey.

To improve convergence, the Hierarchical Multi-stock and 
Single-stock assessment models were initialised later under the **Mod**
and **Poor** data scenarios, with the starting year of the
assessments set to the first year with index data, which was 1984 in
HSHG for both scenario, and 1997 or 2003 for other areas under
the **Mod** and **Poor** scenarios, respectively. 


### Performance evaluation

#### Omniscient manager simulations

Assessment model performance was measured against a simulated omniscient 
fishery manager who is aware of all the future consequences of harvest
decisions and is, therefore, able to adapt the management to meet specific 
quantitative objectives under any process error conditions 
[@walters1998evaluation]. Omniscient manager solutions were used rather
than equilibrium based metrics [@punt2016management] because most stocks
were in a healthy state in 2016 (i.e. above single-species $B_{MSY}$, 
Table 2) and, therefore, the time-path of fishery development was
important [@walters1988experimental].

The omniscient manager was implemented as an optimisation
of future fishing effort by area (Appendix B), with the objective
function defined as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{O}  = \left[\sum_{s,p}
                   -\log(\bar{C}_{s,p,\cdot}) \right] + 
                    \mathcal{P}_{diff}\left(\sum_p E_{p,\cdot}\right) +
                    \mathcal{P}_{init}\left(\sum_p E_{p,2017}\right), 
\end{equation}
where $-\log \bar{C}_{s,p,\cdot}$ is the negative log of total
future catch for species $p$ in area $p$ over the projection period 
(equivalent to maximising catch). Penalty functions $\mathcal{P}$ 
(eq. B.1) were applied for annual changes in total effort across all 
three areas being above 20% ($\mathcal{P}_{diff}$) to match the TAC 
smoother in stochastic experiments, and differences greater than 10% 
between the last year of historical effort and the first year $2017$ of 
simulated effort ($\mathcal{P}_{init}$). 

An omniscient manager solution was obtained for each stochastic
trajectory in the stochcastic management simulations. Each replicate was 
run for 80 years to reduce end effects, such as transient dynamics at the 
beginning of the projection, or a lack of consequences for overfishing 
at the end of the projection.

#### Cumulative catch loss

For each stochastic trajectory, the cumulative absolute loss 
in catch was calculated  as [@walters1998evaluation]:
\begin{align}
L_{s,p} &= \sum_{t = T_1}^{T_2} \vert C_{s,p,t,sim} - C_{s,p,t,omni} \vert,
\end{align}
where the $C_{s,p,t,\cdot}$ values were commercial trawl catch for 
species $s$ and stock $p$ from stochastic simulations ($sim$) or the 
omniscient manager simulation ($omni$) simulation. When repeated over 
all random seed values, the loss functions generated a distribution 
of cumulative catch loss, which were then used to determine relative 
performance of each assessment model under the three data scenarios. 
Cumulative loss was calculated for the ten year period $T_1 = 2028$ to
$T_2 = 2037$, chosen in the middle of the projection period because 
dynamics in the earlier time were dominated by the smoothers on effort 
and catch for the omniscient manager and TACs, respectively, and after 
2028 the omniscient manager's median effort has reached a stable 
state near the multi-species optimum. Biomass loss was also 
calculated, but inferences about assessment method performance in 
preliminary simulations were not qualitatively different between 
the two metrics, so catch loss was reported only, with biomass risk for 
each stock indicated in reference to a critically overfished level,
defined as 40\% of their individual single-species $B_{MSY}$ value 
[@DFO2006A-Harvest-Strat].

Cumulative absolute catch loss was used to calculate the 
relative rank of each assessment model for each species/stock/OM scenario 
combination, where lower loss ranked higher. Rank distributions
across species and stocks were then used to calculate an
average, minimum, and maximum rank of each assessment model to determine 
the overall performance of each assessment model in each OM scenario.


## Sensitivity analyses

Parameter prior distributions area a key feature of most contemporary
stock assessment models, even in data-rich contexts. Moreover, prior
distributions are a defining feature of hierachical multi-species
stock assessment models. Therefore, we focused sensitivity analyses on
fixed prior standard deviations for leading  parameters $B_{MSY}$ and $U_{MSY}$, and the 
hierarchical shrinkage prior SDs $\tau_q$ and $\sigma_{U_{MSY}}$ (Table 4). 
Analyses were run with 50 simulation replicates for only data-rich and 
data-poor scenarios.
