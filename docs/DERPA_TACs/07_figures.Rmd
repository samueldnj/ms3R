histStatusCap <- "Historical spawning biomass (red line) and catch (grey bars)
for all 9 management units in the DER complex operating model. Species labels are at the top of each
column, and stock area labels are on the right hand end of each row. Points
are scaled commercial CPUE and survey biomass indices, which are scaled from
data to spawning biomass by observation catchability and the ratio of model
estimates of spawning and exploitable biomass, 
e.g. $\\hat{I}^{(s)}_{spft} = \\frac{I_{spft}}{q_{spf}} \\cdot \\frac{\\hat{B}_{spt}}{\\hat{B}_{spft}}$."


yieldCurveCap <- "Operating model equilibrium yield curves for a given
fishing effort for the nine DER complex management units, as well as 
complex yield curves within each stock area. Each panel shows the three
individual DER complex species yield curves within a given stock area in
different colours, and the complex yield curve found by summing the three
yield curves as a thick black line."

omniBtCtTulipsCap <- "Spawning biomass depletion and relative catch 
simulation envelopes for all nine DER complex management units from 
the omniscient manager simulations. Median biomass is shown by the thick 
black line, with the grey region showing 
the central 95% of the distribution of spawning biomass, and thin black lines 
showing three randomly selected simulation replicates. Catch is shown as grey 
bars in the historical period, which represent median catch in the projection, 
with thin vertical line segments showing the central 95% of the catch 
distribution. The depletion level associated with the traditional single 
species optimal biomass $B_{MSY,SS}$ is shown as a dashed horizontal green 
line, while the depletion level associated with our derived complex 
level multi-species optimal yield is shown as a blue horizontal dashed line.
"

omniEffTulipsCap <- "Commercial fishing effort simulation envelopes for 
each stock area. Historical and median simulated effort in the projection 
period are shown by thicker green (comm.hist) and orange (comm.mod) lines, 
while the central 95% of the distribution of simulated effort is shown as 
the orange shaded region in the projection period. Single simulation 
replicates in the projection period are shown as thinner orange lines."
