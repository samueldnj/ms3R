DERcplxMapCap <- "Boundaries for each of the DER complex stock
areas on the BC coast, showing, from north to south, 
Hecate Strait/Haida Gwaii (HSHG), Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS), 
and West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI)."

dataSummFigCap <- "A summary of DER complex data available for fitting the 
assessment model. Panels show species from left to right, and rows show
stock areas from north to south. Each panel is split into two cells, with
the top showing a filled circle when a commercial CPUE or biomass index
observation exists. The bottom cell shows commercial catch (relative to 
the maximum catch) in grey bars."

modelSchemCap <- "Conceptual models of the five assessment model configurations.
In each panel, the nine grey boxes represent each DER complex population, as
indicated by the axis labels. Data are pooled for any population not separated
by a black line, e.g., all nine are pooled in the total pooling case. In the
hierarchical model, the broken lines indicate that data are separated, but
information is shared between populations via the statistical model's 
hierarchical prior distributions."


omniBtCtTulipsCap <- "Spawning biomass depletion and relative catch 
simulation envelopes for all nine DER complex management units from 
the omniscient manager simulations. Median biomass is shown by the thick 
black line, with the grey region showing the central 95\\% of the 
distribution of spawning biomass, and thin black lines 
showing three randomly selected simulation replicates. Catch is shown as grey 
bars in the historical period, which represent median catch in the projection, 
with thin vertical line segments showing the central 95\\% of the catch 
distribution. The depletion level associated with the traditional single 
species optimal biomass $B_{MSY,SS}$ is shown as an open green circle
on the right-hand axis, while the depletion level associated with the 
multi-species maximum yield is shown as a blue closed circle on the 
right-hand axis.
"

omniEffTulipsCap <- "Commercial fishing effort simulation envelopes for 
each stock area. Historical and median simulated effort in the projection 
period are shown by a thicker black line, while the central 95\\% of the 
distribution of simulated effort in the projection period is shown as grey 
shaded region, with single simulation replicates shown as thinner black lines.
The effort level that achieves multi-species maximum yield is shown as
a closed blue circle on the right-hand axis."

lossRankCap  <- "Distributions of AM rankings by cumulative absolute 
loss in catch (kt) for the projection years 2028 to 2037 under each 
assessment model (columns) and OM data scenario (rows). Ranks are 
calculated for each species/stock combination within a replicate, then 
distributions of ranks are across species, stocks, and replicates that 
met the 95\\% convergent AMs criterion. The modal rank is shown as
a dark red bar, and the average rank as a vertical dashed line."

tulipBtCtHMSLowCap <- "Spawning biomass depletion and relative catch 
simulation envelopes for all nine DER complex management units when 
assessed by the Hierarchical Multi-species assessment model under the 
Low data-quality scenario. Median biomass is shown by the thick 
black line, with the grey region showing the central 95\\% of the 
distribution of spawning biomass, and thin black lines 
showing three randomly selected simulation replicates. Catch is shown as grey 
bars in the historical period, which represent median catch in the projection, 
with thin vertical line segments showing the central 95\\% of the catch 
distribution. Coloured circles on the right hand vertical axis show 
the biomass depletion level associated with the multi-species 
(closed blue circle) and single-species (open green circle) 
maximum sustainable yield."


tulipCatLossSSLowCap <- "Catch loss simulation envelopes for 
the six DER complex management units included in the catch loss ranking, 
when assessed using the Single-species assessment model under the 
Low data-quality scenario. Median catch loss is shown by the thick 
black line, the central 95\\% of the catch loss distribution is shown as
the grey shaded region, and the thin black lines show three randomly selected 
simulation replicates. The thick vertical dashed line shows the beginning
of the projection period, and the horizontal thin dashed line shows zero
catch loss."

tulipCatLossHMSLowCap <- "Catch loss simulation envelopes for 
the six DER complex management units included in the catch loss ranking, 
when assessed using the Hierarchical Multi-species assessment model under the 
Low data-quality scenario. Median catch loss is shown by the thick 
black line, the central 95\\% of the catch loss distribution is shown as
the grey shaded region, and the thin black lines show three randomly selected 
simulation replicates. The thick vertical dashed line shows the beginning
of the projection period, and the horizontal thin dashed line shows zero
catch loss."


retroBioSingleRepSSLowCap <- "Operating model spawning stock
biomass (red line), commercial trawl vulnerable biomass (grey dotted line), 
retrospective assesment model estimates of spawning stock 
biomass (thin grey/purple lines), and catch and TACs (grey bars) 
from the first simulation replicate in the Low data-quality scenario and
under the Single-stock assessment model. Catch bars show realised 
catch in grey for the whole simulation period, and unfilled bars 
in the projection period show the difference between MP set TACs 
and realised catch. Coloured circles on the right hand vertical axis 
show the biomass level associated with the multi-species 
(closed blue circle) and single-species (open green circle) 
maximum sustainable yield. Purple lines indicate an assessment with
a non-positive-definite Hessian matrix."


retroBioSingleRepHMSLowCap <- "Operating model spawning stock

retrospective assesment model estimates of spawning stock 
biomass (thin grey/purple lines), and catch and TACs (grey bars)

catch in grey for the whole simulation period, and unfilled bars 
in the projection period show the difference between MP set TACs 
and realised catch. Coloured circles on the right hand vertical axis 
show the biomass level associated with the multi-species 
(closed blue circle) and single-species (open green circle) 
maximum sustainable yield."

catchBioTradeoffCap <- "Tradeoff between catch and biomass 
during the 2028 - 2037 period implied by switching between 
different assessment models under High and Low data-quality scenarios. 
Panels are gridded by species (columns) and stocks (rows), with biomass 
relative to $B_{MSY,MS,s,p}$ on the horizontal axis, and catch 
relative to $MSY_{MS,s,p}$ on the vertical axis. Distributions of
biomass and catch under the omniscient manager are shown by the 
black crosshair, with points indicating optimal biomass and yield
for single species maximum yield (open green circles) and 
multi-species maximum yield (closed blue circles). The biomass 
level at which a stock is critically overfished is shown as a vertical
red dashed line. Coloured point symbols show median biomass and catch 
for over all replicates for different assessment models, with assessment 
models under the same data-quality scenario joined by a solid line 
(High) or dashed line (Low)."

batchLossSensSummaryCap <- "Regressions showing the average 
sensitivity of cumulative catch loss to the prior standard
deviations under each assessment model (colours, line types) for the 
data-rich (left column) and data-poor (right column) scenarios. 
The horizontal axis on each plot shows the prior standard deviation 
(CV for $B_{MSY}$), while the vertical axis shows the standardised 
difference between median cumulative loss for an assessment model and the mean
of median cumulative loss values over AMs, stratified by species
and area. See the online version of the journal for a full colour 
version of the plot."
