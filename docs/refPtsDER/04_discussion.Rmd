# Discussion

In this paper, we estimated steady-state and dynamic optimal harvest
rates maximising multi-species catch and resource rent under various 
correlation scenarios for a simulated multi-species, spatially 
heterogeneous flatfish fishery off the coast of BC, Canada. Optimal 
harvest rates were used to set TACs in closed-loop simulations assuming 
both perfect and imperfect knowledge of stock biomass, estimating the 
risk of including or excluding price and recruitment correlation when 
setting multi-species management objectives.

- Limitations
    - Only technical interacions, no ecological interactions or movement
    - Short price history
    - Some spurious population dynamics estimates
    - ...
- While correlation had a noticeable effect on expected NPV, the influence of
correlation on dynamically optimised harvest rates was very subtle, and 
therefore the risk of incorrectly including or ignoring correlation was very 
low (VAR5\% differed by $\approx$ 10k over 32 years).
    - Correlation in price had a small effect on MEY harvest rates, but 
    the effect of correlation recruitment was trivial.
    - Correlation effect, especially recruitment corr, was likely limited
    by lack of ecological interactions/movement among stocks/species. In 
    multi-stock contexts with spatial movement (e.g. ABFT), where TACs in
    one area could affect the effective harvest rate induced
    by another area's TACs, positive correlation in recruitments would 
    likely strengthen feedback links between areas, creating more
    significant differences between target harvest rates under 
    correlated and uncorrelated scenarios.

For the DER complex, there is little reason not to target
multi-species yield objectives. Even assuming that technical interactions 
can be overcome by targeting and single-species MSY_SS can be achieved
independently for all DER complex stocks, there is little benefit in doing
so. The complex wide catch yield is only 110 tonnes lower for MSY_MS
than the sum of the single species MSY_SS values, and extra targeted fishing 
effort and lower prices caused by the elasticity of demand may dissipate 
any resource rent gains that the higher catch would bring.

The intersection dynamic optima distributions with steady-state solutions 
under all scenarios and objective functions indicated that dynamic 
optima are not statistically different from steady-state optima in the 
presence of recruitment process error and price variation.

Future work: 
    - using this as an operating model to test multi-speces management objectives - could use simpler AM, such as multispecies coastwide, or a DD or SP model.
    - Adding movement hypotheses
    - Adding bycatch - especially for testing above multi-species management objectives, want to have choke effects as an emergent property
    - Adding high-grading
