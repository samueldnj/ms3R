# Discussion

In this paper, we estimated steady-state and dynamic optimal harvest
rates maximising multi-species catch and resource rent under various 
correlation scenarios for a simulated multi-species, spatially 
heterogeneous flatfish fishery off the coast of BC, Canada. Optimal 
harvest rates were used to set TACs in closed-loop simulations assuming 
both perfect and imperfect knowledge of stock biomass, estimating the 
risk of including or excluding price and recruitment correlation when 
setting multi-species management objectives.

- Limitations
    - Only technical interacions, no ecological interactions or movement
    - Short price history
    - Some spurious population dynamics estimates
    - ...
- While correlation had a noticeable effect on expected NPV, the influence of
correlation on dynamically optimised harvest rates was very subtle, and 
therefore the risk of incorrectly including or ignoring correlation was very 
low (VAR5\% differed by $\approx$ 10k over 32 years).
    - Correlation in price had a small effect on MEY harvest rates, but 
    the effect of correlation recruitment was trivial.
    - Correlation effect, especially recruitment corr, was likely limited
    by lack of ecological interactions/movement among stocks/species. In 
    multi-stock contexts with spatial movement (e.g. ABFT), where TACs in
    one area could affect the effective harvest rate induced
    by another area's TACs, positive correlation in recruitments would 
    likely strengthen feedback links between areas, creating more
    significant differences between target harvest rates under 
    correlated and uncorrelated scenarios.


There is little research on the effect of correlation among spatially
heterogeneous species on biological reference points and economic yield.
For example, there may be correlation in recruitments among species and 
areas, implicitly representing responses to environmental effects 
[@dichmont2006management], and there may be correlations in annual market 
price deviations, either positive when demand changes significantly (e.g., 
reductions in demand due to environmental disasters or restrictions
on restaurant trade), or negative when species are substitutable.
While there have been several studies on the effects of environmental
covariates on recruitment [@haltuch2019unraveling], and autocorrelation
in recruitment success [@maunder2019modeling], there are few studies that 
aim to understand the effect of spatial correlation in recruitment for 
multiple target species on biological reference points, fishery objectives, 
and whether there is a risk if those correlations are ignored. In one
example, ignoring simulated spatial correlation in recruitment success 
produced positively biased stock status estimates for Australia's Northern 
Prawn fishery [@dichmont2006management3]. To our knowledge, there are no
studies establishing an effect of correlated temporal price deviations on
optimal economic yield, partly because stochasticity is sometimes ignored
for MEY calculations in the economic literature [@sanchirico2007sustainable; 
@kasperski2015optimal], and landed values are often considered fixed in
analyses in the fisheries literature [@punt2020multispecies; 
@punt2011calculating].


For the DER complex, there is little reason not to target
multi-species yield objectives. Even assuming that technical interactions 
can be overcome by targeting and single-species MSY_SS can be achieved
independently for all DER complex stocks, there is little benefit in doing
so. The complex wide catch yield is only 110 tonnes lower for MSY_MS
than the sum of the single species MSY_SS values, and extra targeted fishing 
effort and lower prices caused by the elasticity of demand may dissipate 
any resource rent gains that the higher catch would bring.

The intersection dynamic optima distributions with steady-state solutions 
under all scenarios and objective functions indicated that dynamic 
optima are not statistically different from steady-state optima in the 
presence of recruitment process error and price variation.
