# Discussion

In this paper, we developed a bio-economic modeling framework to derive 
fishery target reference points aimed at maximising total catch ($MSY_{MS}$) 
and economic yield ($MEY$) from a multi-species flatfish fishery. For
$MSY_{MS}$ reference points, optima were not significantly different betwen 
yield-per-recruit derivations or stochastic optimisation. In contrast, 
$MEY$ reference points were significantly different between the YPR 
derivation and stochastic optimisation, primarily based on the estimated 
negative relationship between household income and unit price.

As expected, setting TACs to maximise resource rents (i.e., targeting
$MEY$) had the best economic and conservation performance. While
there was no unacceptable conservation risk under any of the tested
harvest rates, 

Targeting single-species $MSY_{SS}$ reference points produced better economic 
and conservation outcomes than targeting multi-species $MSY_{MS}$ reference 
points. The superior performance of single-species targets was context 
dependent, where the healthy state of the DER complex in 2016, combined 
with relative catchabilities and market demand, created a situation where 
choke effects generated by filling some species TACs and not others had a 
net benefit. On average, choke species were fished to the target biomass 
of $B_{MSY}$ implied by the harvest rate, while remaining species started, 
and remained, well above $B_{MSY}$ as their TACs were underutilized. 
Simultaneously, rents increased as a result of higher CPUE for 
under-utilised species (differential rent), and increased unit prices via 
the lower catches (a transfer of surplus to the producer). If the choke 
species were rebuilding from highly depleted levels, and prices of each 
species were more different, it is sensible to expect that leaving some 
TACs underutilised would create negative outcomes; for example, when the 
choke species is rebuilding (e.g., Yelloweye Rockfish, *Sebastes 
ruberrimus*) and the under-utilised species is valued much higher (e.g., 
Pacific Halibut, *Hippoglossus stenolopis*) [grey lit?]. In contrast,
while the production may have been available in the DER complex for higher 
levels of fishing targeting $U_{MSY,MS}$, DER complex price elasticities 
of demand implied that the price would decrease, and benefits of the 
increased catch would accrue primarily to consumers, not producers. Moreover,
as time went by in simulations, reduction in price caused by increasing 
household incomes transferred further surplus from producers
to consumers. 

Spatial heterogeneity and market demand were, as predicted, significant 
determinants of fishery reference points. Assuming that prices were 
constant (i.e., infinite PED) meant there was no transfer of surplus to 
consumers with higher catches via downward sloping demand
curves, so higher optimal harvest rates and economic yields resulted under
the YPR derivation. In contrast, while the optimal allocation of effort
was similar, the harvest rates and yields were significantly different
if demand was assumed to decrease with increasing price. 

The effect
of spatial heterogeneity of the DER complex was largely as expected for YPR derivations, but when
$MEY$ was validated in stochastic optimisation, the re-allocation
of effort to take advantage of the differing species compositions as all
prices decreased with household income showed the effect of spatial
heterogeneity on fishery outcomes

In projections, increasing household incomes pushed 
all fish prices down, possibly due to diet switching as household incomes 
grew [@ meat offcuts example; @cheng1988demand]. 
 

Optimal allocation of effort under finite PED was constant at all
  levels of total effort, despite joint inverse demand curves 
  affecting price. This may imply that catchability has a higher
  effect on effort allocation than PED, at least under the YPR derivation,
  as effort allocation depended on price and species composition
 

Validation of YPR reference points via stochastic optimisation showed 
that including future temporal variability had a large effect on the 
optimal harvest rate. 
    
    - Also points out common complaint with MEY targets: they are
    valid right now (or even only for a past time period), and will
    need constant updating. However, frequent model updates to check
    misspecification is a basic requirement of adaptive management 
    approaches [@walters1986adaptive], and updating economic 
    assumptions/models at the same time is of low marginal cost.


The DER complex fishery operating model included technical interactions
only, and neither ecological interactions nor movement between areas were
simulated. While including ecological interactions would certainly make 
reference points estimates more realistic [@collie2001biological; @...], 
there is limited data to parameterise those interactions for most systems, 
including the DER complex. Therefore, the assumptions required for modeling 
the processes may induce more uncertainty rather than less. Further, there 
is limted evidence of ecological interactions among DER complex species in 
other areas [@pikitch1987use; @wakefield1984feeding]. There is also 
limited tagging data observing movement of DER species among areas, and 
some potential biogeographical barriers that likely limit movement. Even
if there were unmodeled, significant, ecological interactions, it may
be that technical interactions are enough to produce, in a rough sense, 
eco-system based fishery management objectives. For example, the lower
target harvest rates associated with $MEY$ objectives are inherently
more conservative, and leaves a larger portion of biomass unfished
to create higher CPUE, and therfore increased rents through lower fishing
costs. That higher standing biomass may implicitly meet ecosystem 
requirements, meaning that $MEY$ targets may represent a less data
intensive, rough approach to ecosystem based fisheries management
[@pauly2020msy]. Future work should incorpororate both ecological 
and technical interactions into an ecosystem or MICE operating model 
and simulation-test the benefits of incorporating one or both types 
into stock assessment or TAC advice [@plaganyi2013integrating; 
@ ecosystemOM].



Ealier version of this work included experiments where dynamic optima
were estimated with and without correlation in price and recruitment
deviations, and cross tested against scenarios with and without the 
same correlation. While simulated correlation in recruitment and 
reference price deviations had an effect on the distribution of fishery 
outcomes (e.g., NPV, biomass), there was little effect on the estimated
optimal harvest rates themselves, and even less effect on the risks 
associated with incorrectly assuming the presence or absence of harvest 
rates when setting TACs, with VAR-5\% differing by around \$10,000 CAD 
over 32 years [refer to supp?]. Moreover, we found that price correlation
had the largest effect, and recruitment correlation almost no effect. 
This is consistent with other recent research that found that synchrony
in recruitment process error among groundfish was dampened by their 
long-lived nature [@oken2020effects], with their standing stocks of 
biomass and longer delays until selected by the fishery almost 
completely compensating for synchrony. However, we do not assert that 
recruitment correlation among species and areas is not an important issue 
in spatial and multi-species fisheries management. Our case was likely 
limited by the lack of ecological interactions/movement among 
stocks/species. We predict that recruitment correlation would have 
more significance in multi-stock contexts that include spatial 
movement (e.g. Atlantic Bluefin Tuna), where TACs in one area could affect 
the effective harvest rate induced by another area's TACs through stock 
mixing [refs]. Then, positive correlation in recruitments would likely 
strengthen feedback links between areas, creating more significant 
differences between target harvest rates derived under correlated and 
uncorrelated scenarios. Recruitment correlation would also play 
a larger role for short-lived species, such as invertebrates 
[@oken2020effects; @dichmont2006management3], or if it was explicitly 
considered in a model-based biomass estimation procedure, affecting
TACs through stock status estimates [@dichmont2006management3].



Looking outward:

Add a couple more refs to econ lit. What can we use this framework
for? 

Effort redistribution as a response to marine spatial planning 
(similar to the effort reallocation that came from simulation above)
