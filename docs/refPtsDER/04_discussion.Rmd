In this paper we fit a hierarchical age-structured stock assessment to 5 species of flatfish, each with 3 stocks.

Challenges:
  - Fitting to length comps (you better get the biology right (ref))
  - overwhelming the likelihood with compositional data
  - integrating growth vs leaving it out

Limitations:
  - No movement
  - No technical/trophic interactions (bycatch ratios??)
  - 

Conclusion:
  - Despite limitations, these hierarchical stock assessment models are a viable method of extending assessments to management units where data are limited or non-existent
  - 

Future work: 
    - using this as an operating model to test multi-speces management objectives - could use simpler AM, such as multispecies coastwide, or a DD or SP model.
    - Adding movement hypotheses
    - Adding bycatch - especially for testing above multi-species management objectives, want to have choke effects as an emergent property
    - Adding high-grading
