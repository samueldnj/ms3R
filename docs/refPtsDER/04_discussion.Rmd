# Discussion

In this paper, we investigate the trade-offs between
conservation and economic outcomes under single- and multi-species
harvest strategies for spatially heterogeneous, multi-species 
fisheries. BC's three-species flatfish fishery is simulated
over three areas, and five harvest strategies are defined based 
equilibrium maximum sustainable yield ($MSY_{SS}$, $MSY_{MSY}$) and 
maximum economic yield ($MEY$) reference points, as well as stochastically 
optimised multi-species reference points $MSY^*_{MS}$ and $MEY^*$. 
For each harvest strategy, economic and conservation performance is 
estimated via closed loop simulation. For $MSY_{MS}$ reference points, 
deterministic and stochastic optima are not substantially different,
given that stochastic optima were medians, and recruitment process errors
are bias corrected. In contrast, equilibrium $MEY$ harvest rates are
significantly higher than their stochastic analogues, as 
future increases in household incomes drove down the unit price, 
indicating that DER complex flatfish are considered an inferior
good, and families will switch from flatfish to more expensive proteins
as incomes increase [@dey2011multistage].

For equilibrium multi-species reference points, catchability appears
to be the major determinant of effort allocation in space. Indeed, 
the allocation is similar among $MSY_{MS}$, $MSY^*_{MS}$, and
$MEY$ reference points. Although species composition and own-price 
elasticity affect the total effort expended, their effect on the 
allocation of that effort among areas was minor. Further, the allocation 
of equilibrium $E_{MEY}$ was insensitive to the value of own-price
elasticity, with both flat (i.e., perfectly elastic) and downward 
sloping demand curves producing similar allocations. Allocations were 
insensitive to the shape of demand curves despite differences
in yields and rents. 

In contrast, market demand had a strong effect on the spatial
allocation of effort under the stochastic optimisations. As demand for 
inferior goods declines with increasing household incomes, 
total effort was reduced, and the highest proportion shifted to the QCS 
area to target Rock sole, which had no upper bound on its unit price thanks 
to a lack of exogenous catch in the USA. Such effects of temporal variability 
in market demand highlight a common argument against using MEY reference 
points: that the assumptions are only valid for a short time and, therefore,
$MEY$ targets require constant updating to stay relevant 
[@dichmont2010implementing]. On the other hand, 
frequent model updates to check misspecification is a basic requirement 
of adaptive management [@walters1986adaptive], and updating economic 
assumptions/models with more recent data at the same time is of low 
marginal cost.

While choke effects are commonly assumed to be inherently negative 
outcomes, this was not obviously the case for the DER complex fishery. 
Choke effects limit harvesters' ability to fully catch a species' TAC, 
and the assumption is that any foregone yield represents an economic 
loss to the fishery [@baudron2015adverse], especially when 
a choke species are of lower value. However, in the DER complex, all 
stocks are similarly priced, so choke effects more often limit excessive 
TACs caused by positively biased biomass estimates and the effect on
rent is more subtle [@johnson2021hierarchical]. Such "positive" choke 
effects are evident under the single-species $MSY_{SS}$-based harvest 
strategy, which produces lower probabilities of overfishing than the 
multi-species $MSY_{MS}$-based strategy. Under the single-species 
strategy, choke species were fished (on average) to the 
target biomass of $B_{MSY,SS}$ implied by the harvest rate, while 
remaining species started, and remained, well above $B_{MSY,SS}$, as 
TACs were underutilized and realised harvest rates were lower. On the
other hand, choke effects represent quota that was allocated by
managers according to the harvest strategy, but never utilised. 
This mismatch still represents lost revenue in the form of 
landings, or unrecoverable fixed costs in the form of lease price. In some
BC fisheries, lease prices exceed 50\% of the landed value of the 
fish [@pinkerton2009elephant], which may be a bitter pill to swallo for 
harvesters that risk leasing quota that they are choked out of utilising.
Such secondary costs of choke effects are not included in this work,
potentially making single-species management seem more optimistic than
in reality. 


Under the single-species $MSY_{SS}$-based strategy, there is a 
perception of lower economic risk. This perception is based on higher 
median NPV than under the multi-species maximum yield strategy. Higher 
NPV stems from an increase in rents early in the projection period, as a 
result of lower fishing costs associated with higher CPUE from under-utilised 
TACs caused by choke effects, and higher unit prices from lower landings, 
combining to transfer surplus from consumers to producers. However, while 
the NPV is higher, the rents still eventually decline to negative under 
the $MSY_{SS}$ strategy after the initial profitable period, but the 
effect is less noticeable given the early profits and assumed discount rate.
Rents decline below zero as unit prices are reduced with increasing 
household incomes, and $MSY$ strategies do not account for changes in 
price. Combined with the secondary costs of choke effects outlined above,
the economic performance of the $MSY_{SS}$ based strategy is much
less desirable than the NPV indicates.

The economic model used for the DER complex is fairly simple, and produces 
upper bounds on resource rents that may positively bias the 
net-present-values in the simulations. For example, fuel and crew share 
were the only variable costs included, but quota lease prices, which are 
a significant expense for many harvesters in this fishery, were ignored. 
While crew share can be considered a constant rate as it was treated here, 
the price of fuel is time-varying, meaning that the marginal cost of 
fishing probably changes year by year. However, time-varying fuel costs 
would require a model to project the price into the future, adding 
variability to the results^[https://doi.org/10.25318/1810025601-eng], 
and would require several assumptions, given volatility and growth 
observed in fuel prices that
has low correlation with GDP or CPI. Further, some choices would simply
add noise, leaving the main findings based on average/median behaviour
practically unchanged. Adding quota lease prices would change the 
allocation of effort over the course of a year, as when price/demand 
drops, the lease price also drops, except for choke species. Choke species 
quota actually becomes more valuable as TAC is decreased, as it is 
required for access to higher value species. Negative correlation 
between the landed price and quota lease price would lead to interesting 
secondary market dynamics and may lead to arbitraging behaviour 
[@oostdijk2020catch]; however, including such dynamics would require 
more detailed effort dynamics, likely at the individual vessel level.

The modeling framework developed in this paper can be extended to help
answer broader ecosystem based fishery management questions. For example, 
the "30x30 initiative" aims to use marine spatial planning processes
to protect 30\% of global oceans in marine protected areas by 2030 
[@collie2013marine]. However, 
there is considerable uncertainty about the effect that spatial planning 
has on the distribution of effort [@hopf2016fishery; @russo2014smart]. 
One approach would be to link effort allocation to the economic model 
to more closely simulate how harvesters choose where to expend fishing 
effort [@hilborn1987general; @marchal2013added; @tidd2012dynamic]. 
A simple, emergent version of reallocating fishing effort to target different
species compositons when prices changed was observed in the stochastic 
optimisations of rent in the DER complex fishery, where effort moved to 
QCS to target higher proportions of Rock sole as prices dropped. Another 
extension could 
evaluate predictors of choke effects, and how they relate to catch/quota 
balancing (TAC utilisation) observed in the past [@marchal2009catch; 
@branch2008matching]. TAC utilisations could be correlated with biomass 
indices and catch series to evaluate observable conditions that may lead 
to choke effects. Those predictors may then have practical utility as 
management 'meta-rules' that allow TACs to be scaled to permit sustainable 
overfishing of choke species to mitigate undesirable choke effects on 
high value species, within reason. Finally, an extension to multi-sector 
fisheries would be very valuable. Multiple gear types would create complex 
economic and catch yield surfaces, where the costs of fishing, catchability,
and selectivity are different for different sectors 
[@krigbaum2021increasing; @guillen2013estimating].  Economic demand may 
also be sector dependent, as different sectors sometimes sell in different 
markets based on the condition or size of landings (e.g., BC Sablefish 
long-line trap and hook fleets sell to Japan, while the trawl fleet sells 
their landings in continental North America). 

## Conclusion

We demonstrate significant benefits of including technical
interactions in multi-species harvest strategies. Harvest strategies
based on multi-species $MSY$ eliminate choke effects, producing higher 
catches while avoiding states of conservation concern when harvest
strategies are repeatedly applied to the DER complex fishery. Low 
conservation concern and higher catches increases food security, which 
is a growing need for the increasing global population. While rents under multi-species $MSY$-based strategies appear 
decline below zero over time, this is largely a function of DER complex
species being inferior goods, which lowers the annual rents from all 
strategies. The same price reductions caused a
reallocation of fishing effort under $MEY$ based harvest strategies, 
highlighting that the optimal fishing effort for a spatially heterogeneous 
fishery is not constant, depending on time as well as space. Finally, 
while choke effects in single-species $MSY$-based strategies protected 
the DER complex from overfishing and maintained higher NPV, 
the behaviour is strongly dependent on the relative health, catchabilities, 
and similar unit price of the DER complex stocks, meaning that the result 
is not general, and should not be taken as supporting evidence for 
business as usual. Despite the protective role of choke
effects for the simulated DER complex fishery, real choke effects will 
still cause frustrations for harvesters when TACs are underutilized, as 
some harvesters will be left holding expensive quota that they are unable
to utilise or sell.
