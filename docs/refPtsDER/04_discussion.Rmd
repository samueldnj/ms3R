# Discussion

In this paper, we used a bio-economic modeling framework combining a
multi-species age-structured stock assessment model with technical 
interactions and time-varying demand curves to derive and test fishery 
target harvest rates maximising multi-species catch ($MSY_{MS}$) and 
economic yield ($MEY$) from a multi-species flatfish fishery. Harvest 
rates targeting $MSY$ and $MEY$ were derived by estimating optimal fishing 
effort under both steady state conditions and price and recruitment 
stochasticity, with stochastically optimised $MEY$ effort levels significantly 
higher than the steady state versions. Steady-state and dynamic optimal 
harvest rates were then used to set TACs in closed-loop simulations 
assuming both perfect and imperfect knowledge of stock biomass, estimating 
the conservation and financial risk of each target in the presence of 
uncertainty and technical interactions.

The conservation status of the simulated DER complex creates a situation
where it is, on average, more economically beneficial to target MSY
than MEY over a shorter time horizon. While the higher median NPV under 
MSY harvest rates appears counter-intuitive, the healthy stock status of 
DER complex stocks produced higher catches at lower effort costs, or 
higher catch per unit of effort (CPUE), that was not captured in the 
equilibrium dynamics assumptions of yield curves. While dynamic
$U_{MEY}^*$ values were higher than their steady state analogues, 


Differences between steady state and dynamic optima depended
on the management target. Catch maximising harvest rates $U_{MSY}$ and
$U_{MSY}^*$ were practically the same, with only very small
differences in biomass and resource rent outcomes when used
to set TACs. On the other hand, there were much larger differences
between steady-state and dynamic

- similarity to simpler cases shows that labour can be saved.




Optimal allocation of effort under PED was constant at all
levels of total effort, despite joint inverse demand curves 
affecting price. This may imply that catchability has a higher
effect on effort allocation than PED, at least under the 
 
Joint demand curves for each species with a constant PED changed 
the optimal allocation of effort from a constant price model. A constant
price model would have 

TV demand - required bounding of prices, with some asymmetry perhaps 
increasing difference b/n SS and dynamic eqbria.

- Limitations
    - Only technical interacions, no ecological interactions or movement
    - Short price history
    - Some spurious population dynamics estimates

These results are consistent with previous
results showing that targeting $MSY_{MS}$ has very low risk for the
DER complex [@johnson2021hierarchical].

Ealier version of this work included experiments where dynamic optima
were estimated with and without correlation in price and recruitment
deviations, and cross tested against scenarios with and without the 
same correlation. While simulated correlation in recruitment and 
reference price deviations had an effect on the distribution of fishery 
outcomes (e.g., NPV, biomass), there was little effect on the estimated
optimal harvest rates themselves, and even less effect on the risks 
associated with incorrectly assuming the presence or absence of harvest 
rates when setting TACs, with VAR-5\% differing by around \$10,000 CAD 
over 32 years [refer to supp?]. Moreover, we found that price correlation
had the largest effect, and recruitment correlation almost no effect.
However, we do not assert that recruitment correlation among species and
areas is not an important issue in spatial and multi-species fisheries 
management, as our case was likely limited by the lack of ecological 
interactions/movement among stocks/species; this is further strengthened
by price correlation having the largest effect, and inverse demand
curves being one of the strong links between areas in our system. 
We predict that recruitment correlation would have more significance
in multi-stock contexts that include spatial movement (e.g. Atlantic
Bluefin Tuna), where TACs in one area could affect the effective harvest 
rate induced by another area's TACs through stock mixing. Then, positive 
correlation in recruitments would likely strengthen feedback links 
between areas, creating more significant differences between target 
harvest rates derived under correlated and uncorrelated scenarios. 
Recruitment correlation would also likely play a larger role if it was
explicitly considered in a model-based biomass estimation procedure, such
as in Australia's Northern Prawn fishery, where ignoring correlation 
positively biased stock status estimates and led to overfishing
[@dichmont2006management3].

didn't notice here in correlation para above.
