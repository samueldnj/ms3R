# Discussion

In this paper, we developed a bio-economic modeling framework to derive 
fishery target reference points aimed at maximising total catch ($MSY_{MS}$) 
and economic yield ($MEY$) from a multi-species flatfish fishery. Closed-loop
simulations of the flatfish fishery showed that setting TACs to maximise 
resource rents (targeting $MEY$) had the best economic and conservation 
performance, which makes sense as $MEY$ is associated with lower harvest 
rates and higher biomass/CPUE. ...

Spatial heterogeneity and market demand were, as predicted, significant 
factors in fishery outcomes. Under YPR calculations, ... 
Over the fishery projections, increasing household incomes pushed all fish 
prices down, presumably due to diet switching as household incomes grew
[@ meat offcuts example; @cheng1988demand]. In response to dropping 
prices, a significant portion of effort was reallocated to QCS, to take
advantage of higher Rock sole prices there. Effort reallocations required
including the spatial hetergeneity



Targeting single-species $MSY$ reference points produced better economic 
and conservation outcomes than targeting multi-species $MSY_{MS}$ reference 
points. The superior performance of single-species targets was context 
dependent, where the healthy state of the DER complex in 2016, combined 
with relative catchabilities and market demand, created a situation where 
choke effects generated by filling some species TACs and not others had a 
net benefit. Choke species were fished to the target biomass of $B_{MSY}$
implied by the harvest rate, while remaining species started, and remained, 
well above $B_{MSY}$ as their TACs were underutilized. Simultaneously, rents 
increased as a result of higher CPUE for under-utilised species (differential 
rent), and increased unit prices via the lower catches (a transfer of
surplus to the producer). If the choke species were rebuilding from
highly depleted levels, and prices of each species were more different, it 
is sensible to expect that leaving some TACs underutilised would create 
negative outcomes. For example when the choke species is 
rebuilding (e.g., Yelloweye Rockfish, *Sebastes ruberrimus*) and the
under-utilised species is worth much more (e.g., Pacific Halibut,
*Hippoglossus stenolopis*) [grey lit?].

Our model of the DER complex fishery included technical interactions
only, and neither ecological interactions nor movement between areas were
simulated. While including ecological interactions would certainly make 
reference points estimates more realistic [@collie2001biological; @...], 
there is limited data to parameterise those interactions for most systems, 
including the DER complex. Therefore, the assumptions required for modeling 
the processes may induce more uncertainty rather than less. Further, there 
is limted evidence of ecological interactions among DER complex species in 
other areas [@pikitch1987use; @wakefield1984feeding]. There is also 
limited tagging data observing movement of DER species among areas, and 
some potential biogeographical barriers that likely limit movement. Even
if there were unmodeled, significant, ecological interactions, it may
be that technical interactions are enough to produce, in a rough sense, 
eco-system based fishery management objectives. For example, the lower
target harvest rates associated with $MEY$ objectives are inherently
more conservative, and leaves a larger portion of biomass in the water,
that may implicitly meet ecosystem requirements [@pauly2020msy]. Future
work should incorpororate both ecological and technical interactions into 
an ecosystem or MICE operating model and simulation-test the benefits 
of incorporating one or both types into stock assessment or TAC advice 
[@plaganyi2013integrating; @ ecosystemOM].

The economic sub-model was fit to a short time series of data. Short
data series are sometimes less informative, such as with the flat
series of Dover Sole price/catch data.

Simulation results show that economic reference points like MEY
likely require regular updating to avoid model mis-specification.
The future price dynamics for all DER complex species




Differences between steady state and dynamic optima depended
on the management target. Catch maximising harvest rates $U_{MSY}$ and
$U_{MSY}^*$ were practically the same, with only very small
differences in biomass and resource rent outcomes when used
to set TACs. On the other hand, there were much larger differences
between steady-state and dynamic

- similarity to simpler cases shows that labour can be saved.




Optimal allocation of effort under PED was constant at all
levels of total effort, despite joint inverse demand curves 
affecting price. This may imply that catchability has a higher
effect on effort allocation than PED, at least under the 
 
Joint demand curves for each species with a constant PED changed 
the optimal allocation of effort from a constant price model. A constant
price model would have 

TV demand - required bounding of prices, with some asymmetry perhaps 
increasing difference b/n SS and dynamic eqbria.




These results are consistent with previous
results showing that targeting $MSY_{MS}$ has very low risk for the
DER complex [@johnson2021hierarchical].

Ealier version of this work included experiments where dynamic optima
were estimated with and without correlation in price and recruitment
deviations, and cross tested against scenarios with and without the 
same correlation. While simulated correlation in recruitment and 
reference price deviations had an effect on the distribution of fishery 
outcomes (e.g., NPV, biomass), there was little effect on the estimated
optimal harvest rates themselves, and even less effect on the risks 
associated with incorrectly assuming the presence or absence of harvest 
rates when setting TACs, with VAR-5\% differing by around \$10,000 CAD 
over 32 years [refer to supp?]. Moreover, we found that price correlation
had the largest effect, and recruitment correlation almost no effect.
However, we do not assert that recruitment correlation among species and
areas is not an important issue in spatial and multi-species fisheries 
management, as our case was likely limited by the lack of ecological 
interactions/movement among stocks/species; this is further strengthened
by price correlation having the largest effect, and inverse demand
curves being one of the strong links between areas in our system. 
We predict that recruitment correlation would have more significance
in multi-stock contexts that include spatial movement (e.g. Atlantic
Bluefin Tuna), where TACs in one area could affect the effective harvest 
rate induced by another area's TACs through stock mixing. Then, positive 
correlation in recruitments would likely strengthen feedback links 
between areas, creating more significant differences between target 
harvest rates derived under correlated and uncorrelated scenarios. 
Recruitment correlation would also likely play a larger role if it was
explicitly considered in a model-based biomass estimation procedure, such
as in Australia's Northern Prawn fishery, where ignoring correlation 
positively biased stock status estimates and led to overfishing
[@dichmont2006management3].
