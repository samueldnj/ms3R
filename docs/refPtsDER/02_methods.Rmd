# Methods

The methods are broken into four main sections. First, we introduce the
DER complex fishery system. Second, we detail the bio-economic simulation
model's biological and economic components. Third, we introduce multi-species 
MSY and MEY reference points and discuss their derivation via both 
yield-per-recruit analysis, and via optimisation of simulated 
future fishing effort. Lastly, we outline the closed-loop simulations we use
to compare the management performance between target harvest rates 
associated with the single-species MSY, multi-species MSY, and MEY
reference points for the DER complex.

## Study system 

BC's multi-species complex of right-eyed flounders is a technically 
interacting, spatially heterogeneous group of flatfishes managed across the 
whole BC coast. Although there are several right-eyed flounders in BC 
waters, we focus here on Dover sole, English sole, and Rock sole. Taken 
together, these species comprise a multi-stock complex (DER complex) managed 
in three spatially heterogeneous stock areas (Figure 1), Hecate Strait/Haida
Gwaii (HSHG), Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS), and West Coast of Vancouver
Island (WCVI), as described in @johnson2021hierarchical.


## Bio-economic simulation model

The bio-economic simulation model for the DER complex was comprised of a
biological operating model representing the population dynamics of the 
DER complex in response to commercial trawl fishing effort 
[@johnson2021hierarchical], and an economic model that represents the 
fishing costs and revenues resulting from allocations of trawl effort
in time and space.

### Biological operating model

The biological operating model was an age- and sex-structured, multi-species, 
multi-area population dynamics model. All populations of each species in
each area were assumed to be biologically independent of all other 
populations, with no movement between areas and no ecological interactions. 
Biological independence was somewhat realistic, given gullies in the QCS area
that pose barriers to migration between areas, and evidence of limited 
ecological interactions [@pikitch1987use; @wakefield1984feeding; 
@johnson2021hierarchical; @collie2001biological]. All species within the 
same area were assumed to have technical interactions, represented by 
commercial trawl catchability scalars derived by regressing fishing
mortality on a common index of fishing effort [@johnson2021hierarchical]. 
The population dynamics and fishery parameters were conditioned on fishery 
dependent and independent catch, CPUE, biomass index, catch-at-age, and 
catch-at-length data sampled from the real DER complex from 1956 to 
2016 [johnson2021hierarchical]. Resulting estimates of DER complex life 
history parameters, commercial trawl catchability scalars, and single-species 
yield-per-recruit reference points (assuming commercial trawl fishery 
selectivity) are given in Table 1.

### Economic sub-model

The economic sub-model estimated the resource rent from the DER complex
fishery at each time step. Resource rent was defined as revenues to
license holders minus fuel costs and crew share resulting from the
expenditure of fishing effort to each area, i.e.,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:resRent}
\pi(\vec{E} | \{ \vec{B}_{s,p}\}_{s=1,..,nS,~ p = 1,...,nP}  ) = \sum_{p = 1}^{3} \left( (1 - \psi) \sum_{s} v_{s} \left(\sum_{p'=1}^3 C_{s,p'}(E_{p'},B_{s,p}) \right) \cdot C_{s,p}(E_{p},B_{s,p}) \right) - c_{p} \cdot E_{p},
\end{equation}
where $\pi$ was the resource rent for the whole DER complex fishery,
$\vec{E} = \langle E_p \vert p = 1,2,3 \rangle$ a vector of trawl
effort in each area, each $\vec{B}_{s,p}$ a vector of biomass-at-age 
for species $s$ and area $p$, $\psi$ the assumed crew share of revenue,
$v_{s}(\sum_p C_{s,p})$ was the inverse demand curve (Figure 2, see
Appendix A for details of demand analysis), $C_{s,p}(E_p, \vec{B}_{s,p})$ 
was the catch calculated from the Baranov catch equation given $E_p$ and 
biomass-at-age $\vec{B}_{s,p}$ **[tabref]**, and $c_{p}$ was the fuel 
cost-per-unit-effort of fishing in area $p$ (or $p'$ for the inner 
summation).

The economic sub-model was conditioned on several sources of data.
The inverse demand curves for trawl fishery revenue (Figure 2) were fit 
to DER complex catches, ex-vessel prices, and BC household income data 
detailed in Appendix A. Area-specific fuel costs per unit of fishing
effort were derived from the average cost of fuel per kilotonne (Table 2)
of groundfish catch landed in 2009 [@nelson2011pacific-commerc]. The fuel
cost per kilotonne was then converted to cost per unit of fishing effort 
in each area by scaling by the ratio of catch to fishing effort from each
area in 2009, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
c_{p} = .175 \cdot \frac{\sum_s C_{s,p,2009}}{E_{p,2009}}.
\end{equation}

Fishing costs excluded variable freight/marketing costs, quota leasing, 
and fixed capital expenses such as purchase, repairs, and debt servicing. 
Therefore, the above definition of resource rent was positively biased 
(i.e., an upper bound for economic yield). The problem of including fixed 
costs is that it is generally difficult to assign these costs to a specific 
species (or in this case, multi-species complex) as most vessels fish for 
different groundfish species at different times of year, and sometimes 
with different gear types. Therefore, in the interest of simplicity fixed 
costs were removed from the rent calculation and assumed to be constant 
with effort (i.e., having no effect on the optimal allocation or level of
fishing effort).

## Multi-species MSY and MEY reference points

### Yield-per-recruit derivation

Yield-per-recruit (YPR) derivations of equilibrium yield-curves as a 
function of fishing effort are well-established and standard calculations 
for single-species fisheries and multi-species fisheries 
with technical interactions [@smith1993risk; @murawski1984mixed; 
@pikitch1987use]. Therefore, we did not reproduce the equations here.
Single-species $MSY_{SS}$ reference points were found by solving for the 
effort level that maximises individual species yield within each area, 
ignoring any by-product/bycatch of other species (Table 1). To incorporate 
technical interactions and derive multi-species $MSY_{MS}$ reference points, 
we instead solved for the fishing effort $E_{MSY,MS,p}$ that maximised the 
sum of species yields in area $p$ (Figure 3, Table 3). Fishing effort and 
catch associated with $MSY_{MS}$ reference points were then substituted 
into equation \ref{eq:resRent} to determine the resource rent 
$\pi(\sum_s MSY_{MS,s,p})$ associated with $MSY_{MS}$ reference points, 
under 2016 inverse demand curves (Figure 3).

Economic YPR reference points for a multi-species fishery 
with technical interactions are a straightforward extension of the 
biological reference point calculations [@guillen2013estimating; 
@hoshino2018estimating]. The biological yield-per-recruit reference points 
described above established an equilibrium relationship between fishing 
effort, biomass, and landed catch. Similar to deriving rent for $MSY_{MS}$ 
reference points, yield-per-recruit $MEY$ was derived by substituting the 
equilibrium yield relationship for a given effort into equation 
\ref{eq:resRent}, which was evaluated to give the equilibrium resource rent 
produced by a given fishing effort allocation and the 2016 inverse demand 
curves. The resulting resource rent then defined an economic yield surface 
over three dimensional effort space (one for each area). Optimal effort and 
MEY reference points were found via Newton-Raphson optimisation of resource 
rent over a 3-dimensional effort vector $\vec{E}$. If demand had infinite 
price-elasticity (i.e., a constant price, given a fixed GDP per
capita), then the surface could have been optimised individually for each 
area, similar to the above biological reference points. However, with finite 
elasticities of demand, the link between areas implies that effort must 
be jointly optimised.

For illustrative purposes, we produced area-specific equilibrium 
rent curves assuming the 2016 inverse demand curves $v_s$. Rent curves were
produced via a grid search over 100 levels of coastwide effort 
$E = \sum_p E_p$, equally spaced from 1,000 - 100,000 hours of trawling. 
The grid search assumed that a positive proportion of total BC effort 
would be allocated in each area, and that effort would be allocated among 
areas to maximise rent. Under those assumptions, the optimal allocation of 
effort to each area was determined via Newton-Raphson optimisation of the 
allocation, numerically producing area-specific equilibrium curves.



### Validation via stochastic optimisation

Multi-species $MSY_{MS}$ and $MEY$ yield-per-recruit reference points 
were validated by simulating the DER complex operating model forward in 
time from 2016 in a stochastic optimisation of fishing effort. Effort was 
optimised under two alternative objective functions, either maximising total 
multi-species catch to estimate $MSY_{MS}$
\begin{equation*}
C^{obj} = \sum_{t = 2017}^{2096} \sum_{s} \sum_{p}  C_{s,p,t},
\end{equation*}
or maximise net present value of the DER complex resource
rent over the 80 year projection to estimate $MEY$
\begin{equation*}
\pi^{obj} = \sum_{t = 2017}^{2096} (1 + d)^{-(t - 2016)} \sum_{p} \left[  \left( \sum_s v_{s,t} C_{s,p,t} \right) - c_{p} E_{p,t} \right], 
\end{equation*}
where $d$ is the annual discount rate (Table 2).

In both optimisations, population dynamics were projected 
80 years from the last year of the historical operating model
period (i.e., 2017 - 2096). Projections were repeated over 100 replicates, 
and differed by the random number seed used to draw recruitment process 
deviations 
\begin{align*}
R_{s,p,t} = \overline{R}_{s,p,t} \cdot e^{\sigma_{s,p} \cdot \epsilon_{s,p,t} - 0.5 \sigma^2_{s,p} }, \\
\end{align*}
where $\overline{R}_{s,p,t}$ is the expected Beverton-Holt recruitment,
$\epsilon_{s,p,t} \sim N(0,1)$ is the standardised recruitment process
error, $\sigma_{s,p}$ is the recruitment process error standard deviation.
Note that recruitment process deviations were simulated for all stocks from
earlier than 2017, as the conditioning process was unable to estimate 
deviations up to 2016 based on the age and length composition data. 


Yield-per-recruit equilibria found above were validated against
distributions of effort, yield, and rent produced by the optimisation. 
Stochastically optimised efforts $E^*_{MSY,MS,p}$ and $E^*_{MEY,p}$
were defined as median fishing effort in the 2040 - 2060 time period;
associated biomass, catch, and resource rents were defined analogously
and also denoted by adding an asterisk to the variable denoting YPR derived 
optima (e.g., $B_{MSY,s,p}^*$). Optimal values were taken over the 2040 - 
2060 time period to allow enough time for the effort to stabilise after 
any initial transient period, but also avoided end effects (e.g., high 
fishing mortality) caused by a finite projection time horizon in the
optimisation. 

While total effort was unconstrained in the projections, simulations 
constrained inter-annual changes in coastwide effort to 20\% per year. 
This constraint reflected the potential for new licenses in the fishery, 
but a lag time required for a capital investment (e.g., in new and larger 
vessels) or license reductions (e.g., buybacks). While the effort is 
eventually unbounded, the optimisation method treats the fishery as a 
single firm, rather than an open access regime, so it is possible that 
fishery profits will not be dissipated. The optimisation was the same
as the omniscient manager simulation in @johnson2021hierarchical.

## Harvest strategy performance

Maximum sustainable and economic yield reference points give expected
fishery outcomes when fishing effort can be directly controlled;
however, BC fisheries are managed using an output control quota system 
with total allowable catches (TACs). In output control fisheries, TACs 
are set by taking the product of a target harvest rate and an estimate 
of biomass, while the total number of fishing sets or trawl 
hours are not limited by any regulation. To test the relative risks of
targeting $MSY_{SS}$, $MSY_{MS}$ and $MEY$ objectives, we simulated
the DER complex fishery in closed loop feedback simulations where
catch limits were set using harvest rates based on reference points
derived via both YPR and stochastic optimisation.


We simulated the DER complex forward for 80 years to match the stochastic
optimisation. At each time step, TACs were set using a constant harvest 
rate based on the reference points being tested, i.e.
\[
TAC_{s,p,t} = \hat{B}_{s,p,t} \cdot U_{s,p},
\] 
where $\hat{B}_{s,p,t}$ is a biomass forecast for species $s$
in area $p$ at time $t$, and $U_{s,p}$ is one of the YPR
derived optimal harves rates $U_{MSY,SS}$, $U_{MSY,MS}$, or a 
solution found via stochastic optimisation $U_{MSY,MS}^*$, 
or $U_{MEY}^*$. Biomass forecasts $\hat{B}_{s,p,t}$ were simulated 
with realistic log-normal assessment errors 
\[
\hat{B}_{s,p,t} = B_{s,p,t}\cdot e^{\delta_{s,p,t}}.
\] 
The assessment errors $\delta_{s,p,t}$ were simulated as auto-correlated
assessment errors, where the covariance of the initial 2017 error and the 
covariance of the inter-annual jumps were derived from assessment errors 
for a hierarchical multi-species surplus production assessment model applied
to the simulated DER complex  (see section S.2 for details) 
[@johnson2021hierarchical]. Fishing effort was then set so that at 
least one TAC in each area was fully utilised, but no catch was above any 
one TAC [@johnson2021hierarchical]. To reflect the limits on changes in 
fishing effort in the stochastic optimisation, we placed a limit of 
20\% on interannual differences in TACs for each species/area 
combination.

Fishery performance was measured by comparing the conservation and economic 
outcomes between target harvest rates under each information
scenario. Conservation performance was measured by comparing the distribution
of stock biomass at the end of the projection period (i.e., 2048)
to single-species $B_{MSY}$ values, and economic performance was measured 
as the net present value of the DER complex fishery over the projection 
period. To measure risk, we compared the 5th, 50th (median), and 95th 
percentiles of biomass and NPV distributions. Using a percentile $p$
as a risk metric is known as *Value-at-risk-$p$* ($VAR-p$), which is a 
non-parametric definition of risk commonly used in economic analyses 
[@danielsson2011financial; @morganreuters1996riskmetrics].


## Sensitivities

Economic results depended on the resource rents extracted from each area, 
which were in turn dependent on prices for each species (demand curves) 
and the discount rate applied to calculate the NPV. We tested the 
sensitivity of stochastic optimisation results to these uncertainties in 
seven additional scenarios (Table 3). Scenarios tested the common assumption 
of a constant price, or a flat demand relationship, by setting price 
elasticity of demand to be infinite (i.e., zero price flexibility), and by 
setting the growth in household income $\gamma$ to be zero. Differences in 
projected demand were tested by simulating different rates of growth in 
household income, shifting by 1 standard deviation up and down from the 
recent mean rate of 3.9\% 
^[https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/government-finances/financial-economic-review/financial-economic-review-2020.pdf].
Finally, we tested discount rates at half and twice the 5\% value used
in the main simulations. The stochastic optimisations were repeated for each
of the 7 scenarios.
