## Study system 

BC's multi-species complex of right-eyed flounders is 
a technically interacting, spatially heterogeneous group of flatfishes 
managed across the whole BC coast. Although there are several right-eyed 
flounders in BC waters, we focus here on Dover sole, English sole, and 
Rock sole. Taken together, these species comprise a multi-stock complex 
(DER complex) managed in three spatially heterogeneous stock areas (Figure 1),
as described in @johnson2021hierarchical.


## Bio-economic simulation model

The bio-economic simulation model for the DER complex is comprised of 
two sub-models. The first sub-model is the biological operating model, 
which represents population dynamics of the DER complex in response to 
commercial trawl fishing effort [@johnson2021hierarchical]. The second
sub-model is an economic model that represents the costs per unit
of fishing effort as well as the demand curves for each species,
which determine the relationship between unit price and landed catch (
quantity demanded).

### Biological operating model

The biological operating model is an age- and sex-structured, multi-species, 
multi-area population dynamics model. The model formulation and conditioning
are described in a previous paper [@johnson2021hierarchical], so we only 
summarise it here. The operating model was conditioned on fishery dependent 
and independent data sampled from the real DER complex over the time period 
from 1956 to 2016. Estimates of DER complex life history parameters, commercial 
trawl catchability scalars, and single-species yield-per-recruit reference 
points assuming commercial trawl fishery selectivity are given in Table 1.



### Economic model

Average ex-vessel unit price-per-kilogram data for the DER complex was 
obtained from dockside fish-slips for the BC trawl fishery from 2006 - 2016
[Add footnote for source]. All prices were calculated as total ex-vessel 
revenues divided by total landings, and adjusted to 2016 values to remove the 
influence of inflation using average annual CPI [footnote for ref]. All 
ex-vessel prices were specific to the bottom trawl fishery except for English 
Sole in 2016, which was an outlier with a trawl ex-vessel price almost three 
times the 2006 - 2016 average, and so was replaced with the 2016 ex-vessel 
price for English sole averaged across all available gear types. Fuel costs 
of fishing data were taken from a 2009 economic analysis of the BC 
trawl fishery, and adjusted to 2016 prices using the same CPI
as the unit price adjustment [@nelson2011pacific-commerc]. 

Economic yield was defined as resource rent summed over all species and areas
\begin{equation} \label{eq:resRent}
\pi(\vec{E}) = \sum_{p = 1}^{3} \left( (1 - \psi) \sum_{s} v_{s} \left(\sum_{p'=1}^3 C_{s,p'}(E_{p'}) \right) \cdot C_{s,p}(E_{p}) \right) - c_{p} \cdot E_{p},
\end{equation}
where $\pi$ is the resource rent for all of BC,
$\vec{E} = \langle E_p \vert p = 1,2,3 \rangle$ is a vector of trawl
effort in each area, $\psi = .3$ is the crew share of revenue 
[@nelson2011pacific-commerc], $v_{s}(\sum_p C_{s,p})$ 
is the unit price per kilogram of species $s$, taken from an inverse demand
curve as a function of total catch $\sum_p C_{s,p}(E_p)$ (quantity supplied) 
at effort $E_p$ (dependent on numbers-at-age in each area $p$) calculated
using the Baranov catch equation **[tabref]**, and $c_{p}$ is the fuel 
cost-per-unit-effort of fishing in area $p$ (or $p'$ for the inner 
summation).

The variable fishing costs in each area $p$ were derived 
from 2009 BC groundfish trawl financial data [@nelson2011pacific-commerc].
Variable fishing cost-per-unit-effort was derived from average vessel
variable costs and landings via
\begin{equation}
c_{p} = \frac{.087}{.496} \cdot \frac{\sum_s C_{s,p,2009}}{E_{p,2009}},
\end{equation}
where \$$870,000$ is an average vessel's fuel costs in 2009, $0.496$ 
kt was the average landings, $C_{s,p,2009}$ is the DER complex catch in 
kilotonnes in 2009, and $E_{p,2009}$ is the mean trawl effort targeting DER 
complex species in 2009. Fishing costs excluded variable freight/marketing 
costs, and fixed capital expenses such as purchase, repairs, and debt 
servicing. Therefore, the above definition of fishery profits is positively 
biased (i.e., an upper bound for economic yield). The problem of including 
fixed costs is that it is difficult to assign these costs to a specific 
species (or in this case, multi-species complex) as most vessels fish for 
different groundfish species at different times of year, and sometimes 
with different gear types. Therefore, in the interest of simplicity fixed 
costs are removed from the profit calculation and are assumed to be constant 
with effort, and so do not affect the optimal value of effort.

## Multi-species MSY and MEY reference points

### Yield-per-recruit derivation

The fishing effort/mortality model implies a multi-species MSY for 
the trawl fishery in each area $p$, depending on individual species $s$
productivity, commercial trawl catchability $q^{F}_{s,p}$, and the relative 
catchabilities among species in the area [@pikitch1987use; 
@punt2011calculating], i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
MSY_{MS,p} = \max_{E} Y_{MS} 
    \left( E, q^{F}_{1,p}, q^{F}_{2,p}, q^{F}_{3,p}, Q_p \right),
\end{equation*}
where $E$ is the total commercial trawl fishing effort, $q_{s,p}$ 
is the commerical trawl catchability coefficient scaling fishing 
effort to fishing mortality for species $s$ 
in area $p$, and $Q_p$ is the set of life-history parameters for 
all DER complex species in area $p$. The function $Y_{MS}$ is the 
total multi-species yield in area $p$ as a function of fishing 
effort $E_p$, defined as the sum of species-specific equilibrium yields
\begin{equation*}
Y_{MS} \left(E_p, q^{F}_{1,p}, q^{F}_{2,p}, q^{F}_{3,p}, Q_p \right)
 = \sum^3_{s=1} Y_{SS,s,p} (E_p, q_{s,p}, Q_{s,p} ),
\end{equation*}
where $Q_{s,p}$ is the subset of $Q_p$ containing life history 
parameters for species $s$ in area $p$, and the function $Y_{SS,s,p}$ 
is the traditional single-species yield curve expressed as a 
function of effort rather than fishing mortality.

The level of fishing effort producing multi-species maximum 
yield $MSY_{MS,p}$ in area $p$ is defined as 
\begin{equation*}
E_{MSY,p} = {\argmax}_{E} Y_{MS} 
    \left( E, q^{F}_{1,p}, q^{F}_{2,p}, q^{F}_{3,p}, Q_p \right),
\end{equation*}
with arguments defined above. The fishing effort level $E_{MSY,p}$ has 
an associated equilibrium biomass $B_{MSY,MS,s,p}$ and yield 
\begin{equation*}
MSY_{MS,s,p} = Y_{SS,s,p} (E_{MSY,p}, q^{F}_{s,p}, Q_{s,p} )
\end{equation*}
for each species $s$, which differ from the single-species $B_{MSY}$ 
and $MSY$ when commercial catchability scalars differ between species.


### Maximum economic yield

The maximum economic yield (MEY) was found by substituting the single species 
yield $Y_{SS,s,p}$ into the expression for the net resource rent $pi$ 
(\ref{eq:resRent}) above, and optimising over the vector $\vec{E}$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:econYield}
Y^{econ}_{MS} (\vec{E}, q^{F}, Q, \vec{c}, \vec{v} ) 
  = \sum_p \left[ (1 - \psi) \cdot \sum^3_{s=1} v_s \cdot Y_{SS,s,p} (E_p, q_{s,p}, Q_{s,p} ) \right] - c_p E_p,
\end{equation}
where the function $Y_{SS,s,p}$ and its arguments are as above. The
resource rent equation \eqref{eq:econYield} defines a hyper-surface
in 4 dimensional space, and MEY was found via Newton-Rhapson optimisation 
to find the maximum
\begin{equation}
MEY = \max_{\vec{E}} Y^{econ}_{MS} (\vec{E}, q^{F}, Q, \vec{c}, \vec{v} ),
\end{equation}
and the associated vector of optimal fishing effort 
\begin{equation}
\vec{E}_{MEY} = {\argmax}_{\vec{E}} Y^{econ}_{MS} (\vec{E}, q^{F}, Q, \vec{c}, v_1, v_2, v_3 ).
\end{equation}

For illustrative purposes, equilibrium relationships between fishing effort 
and resource rent within individual stock areas were derived under the inverse 
demand curves $v_s$. To incorporate the effect of spatially heterogeneous 
catch on unit price, a grid search was conducted over 100 levels of total 
coastwide effort equally spaced from 0 - 100,000 hours of trawling, 
assuming that a positive proportion of total BC effort would be allocated 
among areas to maximise rent. For each effort grid point, the allocation 
of effort to each area was computed via Newton-Rhapson optimisation of
allocations, numerically producing area-specific equilibrium curves.

### Estimation by stochastic optimisation

## Dynamic reference points

Dynamic reference points were defined as median model states when
future trawl effort was optimised to either maximise catch or 
net-present-value of the trawl fishery. Optimal trawl effort series
$E_{p,t}$ were found via stochastic optimisation under future 
non-equilibrium fishery dynamics. In both optimisations, population 
dynamics were projected 80 years from the last year of the AM (2017 - 
2096), conditioned on maximum likelihood estimates. Projections were repeated over 100 replicates, and differed by 
the random number seed used to draw recruitment process deviations and 
random walk deviations for the reference unit price $v^*_{s,t}$ at $MSY$ 
of each species in each simulation, e.g., for a projection with no 
correlation the recruitments were given by
\begin{align*}
R_{s,p,t} = \overline{R}_{s,p,t} \cdot e^{\sigma_{s,p} \cdot \epsilon_{s,p,t} - 0.5 \sigma^2_{s,p} }, \\
\end{align*}
where $\overline{R}_{s,p,t}$ is the expected Beverton-Holt recruitment,
$\epsilon_{s,p,t} \sim N(0,1)$ is the standardised recruitment process
error, $\sigma_{s,p}$ is the recruitment process error standard deviation.
Note that recruitment process deviations were simulated for all stocks from
earlier than 2017, as the AM was unable to estimate deviations up to the
end of the AM history given the age composition data. Future ex-vessel 
unit prices were simulated in a random walk with variance estimated when 
fitting the price model in Appendix B to ex-vessel unit price data from
2006 - 2016.

The two alternative objective functions for the optimisations allocated 
effort to either maximise total multi-species catch
\begin{equation*}
C^{obj} = \sum_{t = 2017}^{2096} \sum_{s} \sum_{p}  C_{s,p,t},
\end{equation*}
or maximise net present value of the total DER complex resource
rent over the 32 year projection
\begin{equation*}
\pi^{obj} = \sum_{t = 2017}^{2096} (1 + d)^{-(t - 2017)} \sum_{p} \left[  \left( \sum_s v_{s,t} C_{s,p,t} \right) - c_{p} E_{p,t} \right], 
\end{equation*}
where is the annual discount rate (Table 1).

While total effort was unconstrained in the projections, simulations 
constrained inter-annual changes in effort to 20\% per year. This constraint
reflected the potential for new licenses in the fishery, but a lag time 
required for a capital investment (e.g., in new and larger vessels) or 
license reductions (e.g., buybacks). While the effort is eventually 
unbounded, the optimisation method treats the fishery as a single firm, 
rather than an open access regime, so it is possible that fishery profits 
will not be dissipated. See Appendix A for the details of the optimisation.

Dynamic optimal efforts $E^*_{MSY,MS,p}$ and $E^*_{MEY,p}$, and 
associated biomasses, catches, annual resource rents, and harvest rates 
(denoted by adding an asterisk to the variable denoting steady-state 
optima) were estimated as the median of each quantity across the 
distribution of effort time series under each objective function and 
projection scenario. Median values were taken over the time period 
2040 - 2060, which allowed enough time for the effort to stabilise 
after any initial transient period, but also avoided end effects caused 
by a finite projection time horizon. Dynamic optima were then compared 
to the steady-state optima found via the numerical yield curve analysis 
outlined above, and the 5th and 95th pecentiles of catch and annual 
resource rent distributions were compared between correlation 
scenarios to understand the effect of correlation on each quantity.

## Harvest strategy performance

The above steady-state and dynamic reference points give expected
fishery outcomes when fishing effort can be directly controlled;
however, BC fisheries are managed using an output control quota system 
with total allowable catches (TACs). In output control fisheries, TACs 
are set by taking the product of a target harvest rate and an estimate 
of biomass, while the total number of fishing sets or trawl 
hours are not limited by any regulation. To test the relative risks of
targeting static or dynamic MSY or MEY objectives, we used
closed loop simulation to simulate setting catch limits using harvest
rates that were based on the static and dynamic optima.

The AM was used to condition the operating model (OM) in a closed loop 
simulator to test the risk of ignoring or including correlation when
setting target harvest rates. Our closed loop simulator accounted
for technical interactions by setting TACs (explained below), and then 
increasing fishing effort independently in each area until at least one
species' TAC was exhausted [@johnson2021hierarchical]. The closed loop 
simulation cross tested both TACs set using both static and dynamic 
equilibrium harvest rates under the same scenarios used to derive the
dynamic equilibria above. We tested 8 OM/AM combinations, comprising four 
harvest rates (two steady-state and two dynamic optima), and two levels 
of knowledge in biomass when setting TACs (perfect and imperfect 
information).

At each time step in the closed loop simulation, TACs were set using
a constant harvest rate, i.e.
\[
TAC_{s,p,t} = \hat{B}_{s,p,t} \cdot U_{s,p},
\] 
where $\hat{B}_{s,p,t}$ is a biomass forecast for species $s$
in area $p$ at time $t$, and $U_{s,p}$ is the optimal harvest rate
either derived from steady state solutions, or from the dynamic 
optimisation above. Biomass forecasts were either known perfectly, i.e. 
$\hat{B}_{s,p,t} = B_{s,p,t}$ for the **perfInfo** uncertainty scenario, 
or with a log-normal assessment error 
$\hat{B}_{s,p,t} = B_{s,p,t}\cdot e^{\delta_{s,p,t}}$ under 
the **assErr** uncertainty scenario. The assessment error distribution
covariance matrix was derived from assessment errors in previous work 
[@johnson2021hierarchical], where closed loop simulations were used
to test a hierarchical surplus production assessment model on the DER 
complex (see section S.2 for details).

Fishery performance was measured by comparing the conservation or resource 
rent outcomes between target harvest rates under each information
scenario. Conservation performance was measured by comparing the distribution
of stock biomass at the end of the projection period (i.e., 2048)
to single-species $B_{MSY}$ values, and economic performance was measured 
as the net present value of resource rent over the whole projection period. 
To measure risk, we compared the 5th, 50th (median), and 95th percentiles 
of biomass and NPV distributions. Using a percentile $p$ as a risk metric is 
known as *Value-at-risk-$p$* ($VAR-p$), which is a non-parametric 
definition of risk commonly used in economic analyses 
[@danielsson2011financial; @morganreuters1996riskmetrics].
