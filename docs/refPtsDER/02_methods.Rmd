# Methods

The methods are broken into four main sections. First, we introduce the
DER complex fishery system. Second, we detail the bio-economic simulation
model's biological and economic components. Third, we introduce multi-species 
MSY and MEY reference points and discuss their derivation via both 
yield-per-recruit analysis, and via optimisation of simulated 
future fishing effort. Lastly, we outline the closed-loop simulations we use
to compare the management performance between target harvest rates 
associated with the single-species MSY, multi-species MSY, and MEY
reference points for the DER complex.

## Study system 

BC's multi-species complex of right-eyed flounders is 
a technically interacting, spatially heterogeneous group of flatfishes 
managed across the whole BC coast. Although there are several right-eyed 
flounders in BC waters, we focus here on Dover sole, English sole, and 
Rock sole. Taken together, these species comprise a multi-stock complex 
(DER complex) managed in three spatially heterogeneous stock areas (Figure 1),
as described in @johnson2021hierarchical.


## Bio-economic simulation model

The bio-economic simulation model for the DER complex is comprised of a
biological operating model representing the population dynamics of the 
DER complex in response to commercial trawl fishing effort 
[@johnson2021hierarchical], and an economic model that represents the 
fishing costs and revenues resulting from allocations of trawl effort
in time and space.

### Biological operating model

The biological operating model is an age- and sex-structured, multi-species, 
multi-area population dynamics model. Each area's population of each species
is assumed to completely independent of other populations in other areas,
and to only have technical interactions with other species within the same
area.  The population dynamics and fishery parameters were conditioned 
on fishery dependent and independent catch, CPUE, biomass index, catch-at-age,
and catch-at-length data sampled from the real DER complex over the time 
period from 1956 to 2016 [johnson2021hierarchical]. Resulting estimates of 
DER complex life history parameters, commercial trawl catchability scalars, 
and single-species yield-per-recruit reference points (assuming commercial 
trawl fishery selectivity) are given in Table 1.



### Economic sub-model

The economic sub-model esimated the resource rent from the DER complex
fishery at each time step. Resource rent was defined as revenue (to
license holders) minus fuel costs and crew share resulting from the
expenditure of fishing effort to each area, i.e.,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:resRent}
\pi(\vec{E} | B_{s,p} ) = \sum_{p = 1}^{3} \left( (1 - \psi) \sum_{s} v_{s} \left(\sum_{p'=1}^3 C_{s,p'}(E_{p'},B_{s,p}) \right) \cdot C_{s,p}(E_{p},B_{s,p}) \right) - c_{p} \cdot E_{p},
\end{equation}
where $\pi$ is the resource rent for all of BC,
$\vec{E} = \langle E_p \vert p = 1,2,3 \rangle$ is a vector of trawl
effort in each area, $B_{s,p}$ is a given level of biomass for each species
and area, $\psi$ is the assumed crew share of revenue,
$v_{s}(\sum_p C_{s,p})$ is the inverse demand curve (Appendix A),
$C_{s,p}(E_p, B_{s,p})$ is the catch calculated from effort $E_p$ 
and biomass $B_{s,p}$ using the Baranov catch equation **[tabref]**, 
and $c_{p}$ is the fuel cost-per-unit-effort of fishing in area $p$ 
(or $p'$ for the inner summation).

The economic sub-model was conditioned on several sources of data.
The inverse demand curves for trawl fishery revenue (Figure 2) were fit 
to DER complex catches, ex-vessel prices, and BC household income data 
detailed in Appendix A. Area-specific fuel costs per unit of fishing
effort were derived from the average cost of fuel per kilotonne (Table 1)
of groundfish catch landed in 2009 [@nelson2011pacific-commerc]. The price
per unit of landed was then converted to costs per unit of fishing effort 
in an area by scaling by the ratio of catch to fishing effort from each
area in 2009, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
c_{p} = .175 \cdot \frac{\sum_s C_{s,p,2009}}{E_{p,2009}}.
\end{equation}

Fishing costs excluded variable freight/marketing costs, and fixed capital 
expenses such as purchase, repairs, and debt servicing. Therefore, the 
above definition of resource rent is positively biased (i.e., an upper 
bound for economic yield). The problem of including fixed costs is that it 
is difficult to assign these costs to a specific 
species (or in this case, multi-species complex) as most vessels fish for 
different groundfish species at different times of year, and sometimes 
with different gear types. Therefore, in the interest of simplicity fixed 
costs are removed from the rent calculation and are assumed to be constant 
with effort (i.e., having no effect on the optimal allocation or level of
fishing effort).

## Multi-species MSY and MEY reference points

### Yield-per-recruit derivation

Yield-per-recruit derivations of equilibrium yield-curves as a function 
of fishing effort are well-established and standard calculations for 
single-species fisheries and multi-species fisheries 
with technical interactions [@smith1993risk; @murawski1984mixed; 
@pikitch1987use]. Therefore, we do not reproduce the equations here.
Myopic single-species $MSY_{SS}$ reference points are found by
solving for the effort level that maximises individual species yield 
within each area, ignoring any by-product of other species. To incorporate
technical interactions and derive multi-species $MSY_{MS}$ reference points, 
we solve for the fishing effort that maximises the sum of species yields 
in each area (Figure 3).

Economic yield-per-recruit for a multi-species fishery with technical 
interactions is a straightforward extension of the biological reference 
point calculations [@guillen2013estimating; @hoshino2018estimating]. 
The biological yield-per-recruit reference points establish a 
relationship between fishing effort and landed catch, which can be
substituted into equation \ref{eq:resRent} to derive the resource 
rent produced by a given fishing effort allocation. The resulting
system then defines a economic yield surface over three dimensional 
effort space (one for each area). Optimal effort and MEY reference points 
are then found via Newton-Rhapson optimisation of resource
rent over a 3-dimensional vector of efforts $\vec{E}$. If demand
has infinite price-elasticity (i.e., a constant price), then the 
surface can be optimised individually for each area, similar to 
the above biological reference points. With finite elasticities 
of demand, the link betwee areas implies that effort must be jointly
optimised. 

For illustrative purposes, equilibrium relationships between fishing effort 
and resource rent within individual stock areas were derived under the inverse 
demand curves $v_s$. To incorporate the effect of spatially heterogeneous 
catch on unit price, a grid search was conducted over 100 levels of total 
coastwide effort equally spaced from 0 - 100,000 hours of trawling, 
assuming that a positive proportion of total BC effort would be allocated 
among areas to maximise rent. For each effort grid point, the allocation 
of effort to each area was computed via Newton-Rhapson optimisation of
allocations, numerically producing area-specific equilibrium curves.



### Validation via stochastic optimisation

Multi-species MSY and MEY reference points were validated by
simulating the DER complex operating model forward in time from
2016 and optimising over fishing effort. Effort was optimised under 
two alternative objective functions, either maximising total 
multi-species catch to estimate $MSY_{MS}$
\begin{equation*}
C^{obj} = \sum_{t = 2017}^{2096} \sum_{s} \sum_{p}  C_{s,p,t},
\end{equation*}
or maximise net present value of the DER complex resource
rent over the 80 year projection
\begin{equation*}
\pi^{obj} = \sum_{t = 2017}^{2096} (1 + d)^{-(t - 2017)} \sum_{p} \left[  \left( \sum_s v_{s,t} C_{s,p,t} \right) - c_{p} E_{p,t} \right], 
\end{equation*}
where is the annual discount rate (Table 1).

In both optimisations, population dynamics were projected 
80 years from the last year of the historical operating model
period (i.e., 2017 - 2096). Projections were repeated over 100 replicates, 
and differed by the random number seed used to draw recruitment process 
deviations 
\begin{align*}
R_{s,p,t} = \overline{R}_{s,p,t} \cdot e^{\sigma_{s,p} \cdot \epsilon_{s,p,t} - 0.5 \sigma^2_{s,p} }, \\
\end{align*}
where $\overline{R}_{s,p,t}$ is the expected Beverton-Holt recruitment,
$\epsilon_{s,p,t} \sim N(0,1)$ is the standardised recruitment process
error, $\sigma_{s,p}$ is the recruitment process error standard deviation.
Note that recruitment process deviations were simulated for all stocks from
earlier than 2017, as the conditioning process was unable to estimate 
deviations up to 2016 based on the age and length composition data. 


Yield-per-recruit equilibria found above were validated against
distributions of effort, yield, and rent produced by the optimisation. 
Stochastically optimised efforts $E^*_{MSY,MS,p}$ and $E^*_{MEY,p}$
were defined as median fishing effort in the 2040 - 2060 time period;
associated biomass, catch, and resource rents were defined analogously
and also denoted by adding an asterisk to the variable denoting YPR derived 
optima. Optimal values were taken over the 2040 - 2060 time period to
allow enough time for the effort to stabilise after any initial transient 
period, but also avoided end effects (e.g., high fishing mortality) 
caused by a finite projection time horizon. 

While total effort was unconstrained in the projections, simulations 
constrained inter-annual changes in coastwide effort to 20\% per year. 
This constraint reflected the potential for new licenses in the fishery, 
but a lag time required for a capital investment (e.g., in new and larger 
vessels) or license reductions (e.g., buybacks). While the effort is 
eventually unbounded, the optimisation method treats the fishery as a 
single firm, rather than an open access regime, so it is possible that 
fishery profits will not be dissipated. See Appendix A for the details 
of the optimisation.


## Harvest strategy performance

Maximum sustainable and economic yield reference points give expected
fishery outcomes when fishing effort can be directly controlled;
however, BC fisheries are managed using an output control quota system 
with total allowable catches (TACs). In output control fisheries, TACs 
are set by taking the product of a target harvest rate and an estimate 
of biomass, while the total number of fishing sets or trawl 
hours are not limited by any regulation. To test the relative risks of
targeting single- and multi-species MSY and MEY objectives, we used
closed loop simulation to simulate catch limits set using harvest
rates that were based on the each set of reference points.

At each time step in the closed loop simulation, TACs were set using
a constant harvest rate, i.e.
\[
TAC_{s,p,t} = \hat{B}_{s,p,t} \cdot U_{s,p},
\] 
where $\hat{B}_{s,p,t}$ is a biomass forecast for species $s$
in area $p$ at time $t$, and $U_{s,p}$ is the optimal harvest rate
either derived from steady state solutions, or from the dynamic 
optimisation above. Biomass forecasts were simulated with realistic
log-normal assessment errors 
$\hat{B}_{s,p,t} = B_{s,p,t}\cdot e^{\delta_{s,p,t}}$. The assessment 
error distribution covariance matrix was derived from assessment errors 
in previous work [@johnson2021hierarchical], where closed loop 
simulations were used to test a hierarchical surplus production 
assessment model on the DER complex (see section S.2 for details).
Fishing effort was then set so that at least one TAC in each area
was fully utilised, but no catch was above any one TAC 
[@johnson2021hierarchical]. To reflect the effort increase limits
applied in the stochastic optimisation, we placed a limit of 20\% on 
interannual increases in TACs for each species/area combination.

Fishery performance was measured by comparing the conservation or resource 
rent outcomes between target harvest rates under each information
scenario. Conservation performance was measured by comparing the distribution
of stock biomass at the end of the projection period (i.e., 2048)
to single-species $B_{MSY}$ values, and economic performance was measured 
as the net present value of resource rent over the whole projection period. 
To measure risk, we compared the 5th, 50th (median), and 95th percentiles 
of biomass and NPV distributions. Using a percentile $p$ as a risk metric is 
known as *Value-at-risk-$p$* ($VAR-p$), which is a non-parametric 
definition of risk commonly used in economic analyses 
[@danielsson2011financial; @morganreuters1996riskmetrics].
