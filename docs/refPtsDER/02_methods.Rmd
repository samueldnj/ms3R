# Methods

The following sections introduce our multi-species fishery system, a 
bio-economic simulation for the fishery, multi-species MSY and MEY reference 
points and their derivation via yield-per-recruit analysis and stochastic 
optimisation, and, finally, a closed loop simulation approach to comparing 
management performance between among single-species MSY, multi-species MSY, 
and MEY based harvest policies in the presence of uncertainty.

## Study system 

BC's multi-species complex of right-eyed flounders is a technically 
interacting, spatially heterogeneous group of flatfishes managed across the 
whole BC coast. Although there are several right-eyed flounders in BC 
waters, we focused here on Dover sole, English sole, and Rock sole because
these species together comprise a multi-stock complex (DER complex) managed 
in three spatially heterogeneous stock areas (Figure 1), Hecate Strait/Haida
Gwaii (HSHG, management areas 5CDE), Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS, areas 5AB), 
and West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI, 3CD), as described in 
@johnson2021hierarchical.


## Bio-economic simulation model

The bio-economic simulation model for the DER complex comprises a
biological operating model representing the population dynamics of the 
DER complex in response to commercial trawl fishing effort, and an economic 
model that representing the fishing costs and revenues resulting from 
trawl fishing effort dynamically allocated in time and space.

### Biological operating model

The biological operating model is an age- and sex-structured, multi-species, 
multi-area population dynamics model [@johnson2021hierarchical]. Population 
dynamics are driven by a Beverton-Holt density-dependent stock-recruitment 
model, with female spawning stock biomass assumed to mature according
to a logistic maturity-at-age ogive [age at 50% mat for D, E, R]. Each
cohort experiences sex-specific natural mortality, constant over age and 
time [Table 1]. Fishing mortality-at-age was the product of proportion
of individual fish of each age available to the fishing gear (selectivity), 
trawl catchability for each population, and the trawl effort in each area. 
The population dynamics and fishery parameters were esitmated by fitting the 
model to fishery dependent and independent catch, catch-per-unit-of-effort 
(CPUE or catch rates), biomass indices, catch-at-age, and catch-at-length 
data sampled from the real DER complex over the 1956-2016 period 
[@johnson2021hierarchical]. Resulting estimates of DER complex life 
history parameters, commercial trawl catchability scalars, and single-species 
reference points are given in Table 1.

The DER complex is modeled as nine biologically independent populations,
three species in each of three areas, with no movement among areas and no
ecological interactions within an area. Biological independence was somewhat 
realistic, given the presence of deep gullies in the QCS area that pose 
barriers flatfish migration among areas, and evidence of limited ecological 
interactions [@pikitch1987use; @wakefield1984feeding; 
@johnson2021hierarchical; @collie2001biological].


### Economic sub-model

The economic sub-model determins the resource rent from the DER complex
fishery at each annual time step. Resource rent is defined as revenues to
license holders minus fuel costs and crew share resulting from the
expenditure of fishing effort to each area, i.e.,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:resRent}
\pi(\vec{E} | \{ \vec{B}_{s,p}\}_{s=1,..,nS,~ p = 1,...,nP}  ) = \sum_{p = 1}^{3} \left( (1 - \psi) \sum_{s} v_{s} \left(\sum_{p'=1}^3 C_{s,p'}(E_{p'},B_{s,p}) \right) \cdot C_{s,p}(E_{p},B_{s,p}) \right) - c_{p} \cdot E_{p},
\end{equation}
where $\pi$ is the resource rent for the DER complex fishery,
$\vec{E} = \langle E_p \vert p = 1,2,3 \rangle$ a vector of trawl
effort in each area $p$, each $\vec{B}_{s,p}$ is a vector of biomass-at-age 
for species $s$ and area $p$, $\psi$ the assumed crew share of revenue,
$v_{s}(\sum_p C_{s,p})$ is the inverse demand curve (Figure 2), and
$c_{p}$ is the fuel cost-per-unit-effort of fishing in area $p$ 
(or $p'$ for the inner summation). The catch $C_{s,p}(E_p, \vec{B}_{s,p})$ 
is calculated from the Baranov catch equation given effort $E_p$ and 
biomass-at-age $\vec{B}_{s,p}$ [@johnson2021hierarchical].

The inverse demand curves shown in Figure 2 were fit to DER complex 
catches, ex-vessel prices, and BC household income data (Appendix A). 
Area-specific fuel costs per trawl hour were derived from the average cost 
of fuel to catch on kilotonne of groundfish catch in 2009
[@nelson2011pacific-commerc], adjusted to 2016 prices (Table 2). The fuel 
cost per kilotonne was then converted to cost per unit of fishing effort 
in each area by scaling by the ratio of catch to fishing effort from each 
area in 2009, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
c_{p} = .193 \cdot \frac{\sum_s C_{s,p,2009}}{E_{p,2009}}.
\end{equation}

Fishing costs excluded variable freight and marketing costs, quota leasing, 
and fixed capital expenses such as purchase, repairs, and debt servicing. 
Therefore, the above definition of resource rent provides an upper bound 
for economic yield. The problem of including fixed costs is that it is 
generally difficult to assign these costs to a specific 
species (or in this case, multi-species complex) as most vessels fish for 
different groundfish species at different times of year, and sometimes 
with different gear types. Therefore, for simplicity, fixed costs were 
excluded from the rent calculation and assumed to be constant.

## Multi-species MSY and MEY reference points

### Yield-per-recruit derivation

Yield-per-recruit (YPR) derivations of equilibrium yield-curves as a 
function of fishing effort are standard calculations for both single-species 
and multi-species fisheries with technical interactions [@smith1993risk; 
@murawski1984mixed; @pikitch1987use]. Therefore, we do not reproduce the 
equations here. Single-species $MSY_{SS}$ reference points (ignoring
technical interactions) are found by maximising individual species $s$
yield within each area $p$ over fishing effort to derive the optimal effort
$E_{MSY,SS,s,p}$, ignoring any by-product/bycatch of other species (Table 1). 
Multi-species $MSY_{MS}$ reference points with technical interactions are 
derived by maximising the sum of individual species yields (complex yield) 
over effort within area $p$, producing $E_{MSY,MS,p}$ (Figure 3, Table 3). 
The resource rent produced at $MSY_{MS}$ is found by substituting catch
and effort into the rent equation \ref{eq:resRent} to determine the 
resource rent $\pi(\sum_s MSY_{MS,s,p})$ under 2016 inverse demand 
curves (Figure 3).

Economic YPR reference points for a multi-species fishery 
with technical interactions are a straightforward extension of the 
biological reference point calculations [@guillen2013estimating; 
@hoshino2018estimating]. The biological yield-per-recruit reference points 
described above establish an equilibrium relationship between fishing 
effort, biomass, and landed catch. Similar to deriving rent for $MSY_{MS}$ 
reference points, yield-per-recruit $MEY$ is derived by substituting the 
equilibrium yield relationship for a given effort into equation 
\ref{eq:resRent}, which is then evaluated to give the equilibrium resource 
rent produced by a given fishing effort allocation and the 2016 inverse demand 
curves. The resulting resource rents then define an economic yield surface 
over three dimensional effort space (one for each area). Optimal effort and 
$MEY$ reference points are found via Newton-Raphson optimisation of resource 
rent over the 3-dimensional effort vector $\vec{E}$. If demand has infinite 
price-elasticity (i.e., a constant price, given a fixed GDP per
capita), then the surface may be optimised individually for each 
area, similar to the above biological reference points. However, finite 
own-price elasticities create a link among areas that requires joint
optimisation of the rents.

For illustrative purposes, area-specific equilibrium rent curves
are produced via a grid search over fishing effort, assuming 2016 inverse 
demand curves $v_s$. Effort grids included 100 levels of coastwide effort 
$E = \sum_p E_p$, equally spaced from 1,000 - 100,000 hours of trawling. 
At each grid point, the allocation of total effort to each area as optimised
assuming that some fishing would occur in all areas, and that effort would be 
allocated to maximise rent. Under those assumptions, the optimal allocation of 
effort to each area was determined via Newton-Raphson optimisation of the 
allocation, numerically producing area-specific equilibrium curves.



### Validation via stochastic optimisation

Multi-species $MSY_{MS}$ and $MEY$ reference points are validated by 
simulation. The simualated DER complex is projected from 2016 and fishing effort
is optimised under two alternative objective functions. The first objective
function maximises total multi-species catch to estimate $MSY_{MS}$
\begin{equation*}
C^{obj} = \sum_{t = 2017}^{2096} \sum_{s} \sum_{p}  C_{s,p,t},
\end{equation*}
and the second maximises the net present value (NPV) of the DER complex 
resource rent over the 80 year projection to estimate $MEY$
\begin{equation*}
\pi^{obj} = \sum_{t = 2017}^{2096} (1 + d)^{-(t - 2016)} \sum_{p} \left[  \left( \sum_s v_{s,t} C_{s,p,t} \right) - c_{p} E_{p,t} \right], 
\end{equation*}
where $d$ is the annual discount rate (Table 2).

In both optimisations, population dynamics are projected 
80 years over 2017 - 2096. Projections are repeated over 100 replicates, 
differing by the random number seed used to draw recruitment process 
deviations 
\begin{align*}
R_{s,p,t} = \overline{R}_{s,p,t} \cdot e^{\sigma_{s,p} \cdot \epsilon_{s,p,t} - 0.5 \sigma^2_{s,p} }, \\
\end{align*}
where $\overline{R}_{s,p,t}$ is the expected Beverton-Holt recruitment,
$\epsilon_{s,p,t} \sim N(0,1)$ is the standardised recruitment process
error, $\sigma_{s,p}$ is the recruitment process error standard deviation.
Note that recruitment process deviations are simulated for all stocks from
earlier than 2017, as the OM fitting process was unable to estimate 
deviations up to 2016 based on the age and length composition data. 


Yield-per-recruit reference points found above are validated against
distributions of effort, yield, and rent produced by the optimisation. 
Stochastically optimised efforts $E^*_{MSY,MS,p}$ and $E^*_{MEY,p}$ are
defined as median fishing effort in 2040 - 2060, and the associated biomass, 
catch, and resource rents were defined analogously, and also denoted by 
adding an asterisk to the variable denoting YPR derived optimum (e.g., 
$B_{MSY,s,p}^*$). Optimal values were taken over the 2040 - 2060 time period 
to allow enough time for the effort to stabilise after any initial transient 
period, but also avoid end effects (e.g., high fishing mortality) caused by 
a finite projection time horizon in the optimisation. 

While total effort is unconstrained in the projections, simulations 
constrain inter-annual changes in coastwide effort to 20\% per year. 
This constraint reflects the potential for new licenses in the fishery, 
but creates a lag time required for a capital investment (e.g., in new 
and larger vessels) or license reductions (e.g., buybacks). While the effort 
is eventually unbounded, the optimisation method treats the fishery as a 
single firm, rather than an open access regime, so it is possible that 
fishery profits will not be dissipated. The optimisation was the same
as the omniscient manager simulation in @johnson2021hierarchical.

## Harvest strategy performance

Fishery reference points need to be tested in realistic simulations that
mimic real fishery management process. While optimal fishing efforts have
theoretical value it is difficult to control fishing effort well, and most 
modern fisheries are instead managed using an output control quota system 
with total allowable catches (TACs). TACs are set by taking the product of 
a target harvest rate and a biomass estimate, while 
the total amount of effort (e.g. number of fishing vessels, sets, or trawl 
hours) are not limited by any regulation. To test the relative risks of 
targeting $MSY_{SS}$, $MSY_{MS}$ and $MEY$ objectives, harvest rates based 
on DER complex reference points are evaluated in closed loop feedback 
simulations.

The DER complex is projected forward for 80 years, matching the 
stochastic optimisations. At each time step, TACs are set using a constant 
harvest rate based on the reference points being tested, i.e.
\[
TAC_{s,p,t} = \hat{B}_{s,p,t} \cdot U_{s,p},
\] 
where $\hat{B}_{s,p,t}$ is a biomass forecast for species $s$
in area $p$ at time $t$, and $U_{s,p}$ is one of the YPR
derived optimal harves rates $U_{MSY,SS}$, $U_{MSY,MS}$, or a 
solution found via stochastic optimisation $U_{MSY,MS}^*$, 
or $U_{MEY}^*$. Biomass forecasts $\hat{B}_{s,p,t}$ are simulated 
with auto-correlated log-normal assessment errors 
\[
\hat{B}_{s,p,t} = B_{s,p,t}\cdot e^{\delta_{s,p,t}}.
\] 
The parameters for the $\delta_{s,p,t}$ distribution are estimated
from assessment errors of a hierarchical multi-species surplus production 
assessment model applied to the simulated DER complex (see section S.2 for 
details) [@johnson2021hierarchical]. Once TACs are set, fishing effort
is allowed to increased until at least one TAC in each area is fully 
utilised, after which the area is closed to fishing 
[@johnson2021hierarchical]. To reflect the limits on changes in 
fishing effort in the stochastic optimisation, interannual differences
in catch are limited to 20\% for each species/area combination.

Fishery performance is measured by comparing the conservation and economic 
outcomes between target harvest rates. Conservation performance is determined
based on the distribution of spawning biomass compared to single-species 
$B_{MSY,SS}$ over 2040 - 2060. Economic performance is measured as the NPV 
of the DER complex fishery over the whole projection. To measure risk, we 
compared the 5th, 50th (median), and 95th percentiles of biomass and NPV 
distributions. Using a percentile $p$ as a risk metric is known as
*Value-at-risk-$p$* ($VAR-p$), a non-parametric definition of risk 
commonly used in economic analyses [@danielsson2011financial; 
@morganreuters1996riskmetrics].


## Sensitivities

Economic results depend on the resource rents, which in turn depend on 
prices for each species (demand curves) and discount rates applied in
NPV calculations. The sensitivity of stochastic optimisation results
(under the rent objective) was tested against demand and discount rate 
uncertainties in seven additional scenarios (Table 3). Three 
scenarios tested alternative demand assumptions, specifically a flat demand 
relationship, simulated by refitting demand curves with an infinite PED
(i.e., zero price flexibility, Appendix A), and a constant demand over 
time by setting the growth in household income $\gamma = 0$. The remaining 
four scenarios tested sensitivites to assumed discount rates $\delta$ and 
growth rates $\gamma$ of household income (Table 3). Alternative discount 
rates were half and twice the 5\% value used in the main simulations. 
Alternative rates of growth in household income were 1 standard deviation 
higher and lower than the recent mean rate of 3.9\%
