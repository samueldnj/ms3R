# Methods

The following sections introduce the multi-species fishery system,
then describe a bio-economic simulation model of the fishery, and
describe multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference points derived via 
yield-per-recruit analysis and stochastic optimisation. Finally, we
present a closed loop simulation approach, which we use to compare 
management performance among the harvest strategies in the 
presence of uncertainty.

## Study system 

BC's multi-species complex of right-eyed flounders is a technically 
interacting, spatially heterogeneous group of flatfishes managed across the 
whole BC coast. Although there are several right-eyed flounders in BC 
waters, we focused here on Dover sole, English sole, and Rock sole because
these species together comprise a multi-stock complex (DER complex) managed 
in three spatially heterogeneous stock areas (Figure 1), Hecate Strait/Haida
Gwaii (HSHG, management areas 5CDE), Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS, areas 5AB), 
and West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI, 3CD), as described in 
@johnson2021hierarchical. 

The DER complex is primarily fished by trawl vessels managed under
an individual transferable quota system, with negligible 
levels of catch by other gear types^[Unpublished catch data, hosted at
the Pacific Biological Station of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada, in Nanaimo,
BC]. Catch is supplied to local BC markets (48\% of all seafood), as well 
as exported interprovincially (9\% of all seafood) and internationally 
(43\% of all seafood)^[BC Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector, 2016 Edition; 
https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/agriculture-and-seafood/statistics/industry-and-sector-profiles/sector-reports/british_columbias_fisheries_and_aquaculture_sector_2016_edition.pdf]. 
International exports of Soles are primarily to the US (10\%) and China 
(87\%)^[2018 British Columbia Agrifood and Seafood International Export 
Highlights; https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/agriculture-and-seafood/statistics/market-analysis-and-trade-statistics/2018_bc_agrifood_and_seafood_export_highlights.pdf].

A demand analysis shows that the DER complex may be inferior goods
(Appendix A). An inferior good is one where demand decreases with 
increasing income, as people with more disposable income buy higher
quality substitutes. This makes sense for DER complex species, as
flatfish are inexpensive and most substitutes are priced
higher. Potential substitutes were not formally included in demand
analyses, but include Sablefish (*Anoplopma fimbria*), Salmon 
(*Onchorynchus Spp.*), and Halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*), which 
are all higher priced and considered more popular protein sources.



## Bio-economic simulation model

The bio-economic simulation model for the DER complex comprises a
biological operating model representing the population dynamics of the 
DER complex, and an economic model representing the fishing costs and 
revenues resulting from trawl fishing effort dynamically allocated in 
time and space.

### Biological operating model

The DER complex is modeled as nine biologically independent populations,
three species in each of three areas, with no movement among areas and no
ecological interactions within an area. Biological independence is somewhat 
realistic, given the presence of deep gullies in the QCS area that pose 
barriers to flatfish migration between areas, along with evidence of limited 
ecological interactions [@pikitch1987use; @wakefield1984feeding; 
@johnson2021hierarchical; @collie2001biological].

The biological operating model is an age- and sex-structured, multi-species, 
multi-stock (area) population dynamics model [@johnson2021hierarchical]. For
the remainder of the paper, species are indexed by $s$, and areas by $p$.
Population dynamics of each stock is driven by a compensatory Beverton-Holt 
stock-recruitment model, where the stock is defined as mature female 
spawning biomass, with unfished biomass $B_0$ producing unfished recruitment
$R_0$, and stock-recruit steepness $h$, which is the fraction of $R_0$
expected when biomass is 20% of unfished (Table 1) [@mangel2010reproductive]. 
Each species in the DER complex has a unique maturity-at-age schedule. 
Natural mortality is stock- and sex-specific, but constant over age and time
($M_m,M_f$, Table 1). Fishing mortality-at-age is the product of the 
proportion of individual fish of each age susceptible to the 
fishing gear (selectivity), trawl catchability $q^{F}_{s,p}$ for each 
population, and the trawl effort $E_p$ in each area. The population 
dynamics and fishery parameters are estimated by fitting the 
model to fishery dependent and independent catch, catch-per-unit-of-effort 
(CPUE or catch rates), biomass indices, catch-at-age, and catch-at-length 
data sampled from the real DER complex over the 1956-2016 period. For
further details, see @johnson2021hierarchical.


### Economic sub-model

The economic sub-model determines the resource rent from the DER complex
fishery at each annual time step. Resource rent is defined as revenues to
license holders minus variable costs resulting from the
expenditure of fishing effort to each area, i.e.,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:resRent}
\pi(\vec{E} | \{ \vec{B}_{s,p}\}_{s=1,..,S,~ p = 1,...,P}  ) = \sum_{p = 1}^{3} \left( (1 - \psi) \sum_{s} v_{s} \left(\sum_{p'=1}^3 C_{s,p'}(E_{p'},B_{s,p}) \right) \cdot C_{s,p}(E_{p},B_{s,p}) \right) - c_{p} \cdot E_{p},
\end{equation}
where $\pi$ is the resource rent for the whole DER complex fishery,
$\vec{E} = \langle E_p \vert p = 1,2,3 \rangle$ is a vector of trawl
effort allocated to each area $p$, each $\vec{B}_{s,p}$ is a vector 
of biomass-at-age for species $s$ and area $p$, $\psi$ is the assumed 
crew share of revenue, $v_{s}(\sum_p C_{s,p})$ is the inverse demand 
curve relating the unit price to the quantity landed $C_{s,p}$, and $c_{p}$ 
is the fuel cost-per-unit-effort of fishing in area $p$ (or $p'$ for 
the inner summation). The catch $C_{s,p}(E_p, \vec{B}_{s,p})$ is calculated 
from the Baranov catch equation given effort $E_p$ and biomass-at-age
$\vec{B}_{s,p}$ [@johnson2021hierarchical], i.e.,
\begin{equation}
C_{s,p}(E_p, \vec{B}_{s,p}) = \sum_{a = 1}^{A_s} \frac{Sel_{a,x,s,p} q^F_{s,p} E_p}{ Z_{a,x,s,p} } B_{a,s,p} e^{-Z_{a,x,s,p}},
\end{equation}
where $A_s$ is the plus-group age for species $s$, $Sel_{a,x,s,p}$ is 
selectivity-at-age, and $Z_{a,x,s,p}$ is total mortality-at-age, with
age indexed by $a$ and sex indexed by $x$.

The inverse demand curves (Figure 2) are fit to DER complex 
catches, ex-vessel prices, and BC household income data (Appendix A).
While the DER complex species are sold outside of BC, household income
in all markets is highly correlated. Therefore, while the exact income 
elasticity estimates will differ for each market, the sign of the elasticity 
would still be negative, implying that the DER complex species are inferior
goods. Area-specific fuel costs per trawl hour were derived from the 
average cost of fuel to catch one kilotonne of groundfish catch in 2009
[@nelson2011pacific-commerc], adjusted to 2016 prices (Table 2). The fuel 
cost per kilotonne was then converted to cost per unit of fishing effort 
in each area by scaling by the ratio of catch to fishing effort from each 
area in 2009, i.e., 
\begin{equation*}
c_{p} = .193 \cdot \frac{\sum_s C_{s,p,2009}}{E_{p,2009}}.
\end{equation*}

Fishing costs included only variable costs such as fuel and crew share,
and excluded all fixed costs (e.g., repairs and debt service). Fixed costs 
were ignored, since they are difficult to assign to individual species or
multi-species complexes. As a result, the above definition of resource rent 
provides an upper bound for economic yield.

## Multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference points

### Optimal yield and reference points via equilibrium analysis

Equilibrium yield-per-recruit reference points establish an equilibrium 
relationship between fishing effort, biomass-per-recruit, and average
annual yield (i.e., a yield curve). Yield curves are computed via 
standard equations for both single-species and multi-species fisheries 
with technical interactions [@smith1993risk; @murawski1984mixed; 
@pikitch1987use]. Therefore, the equations are not reproduced here. 
Single-species $MSY_{SS}$ reference points (ignoring technical interactions) 
are found by maximising individual species $s$ yield within each area $p$ 
over fishing effort to derive the optimal species-specific effort
$E_{MSY,SS,s,p}$ that should be applied to each area, ignoring any 
by-product/bycatch of other species (Table 1). Multi-species $MSY_{MS}$ 
reference points with technical interactions are derived by maximising 
the sum of individual species yields (complex yield) over effort within 
area $p$, producing $E_{MSY,MS,p}$ (Figure 3, Table 3). The resource rent 
produced at $MSY_{MS}$ is found by substituting equilbrium effort and 
biomass into the \eqref{eq:resRent} using the 2016 version of the inverse 
demand curves.

The method for deriving economic yield reference points for a multi-species 
fishery with technical interactions depends on the relationship between
unit price and landings. In general, $MEY$ is derived by substituting the 
equilibrium yield relationship for a given effort into equation 
\ref{eq:resRent}, which, similar to deriving rent for $MSY_{MS}$ reference 
points, is then evaluated to give the equilibrium resource rent produced by 
a given fishing effort allocated among areas [s@guillen2013estimating; 
@hoshino2018estimating]. If demand is perfectly elastic (i.e., 
a constant price with respect to landings), as is commonly assumed for
internationally traded fish, then the surface may be optimised individually 
for each area. If, instead, a finite own-price elasticity is assumed 
(Appendix A), then the unit price for each species changes with the 
quantity landed, and spatial heterogeneity in species compositions implies 
spatial heterogeneity in rents. The resulting relationship between rents 
and effort defines a surface over three dimensional effort space (one for 
each area), and optimal effort and $MEY$ reference points are found via 
Newton-Raphson optimisation of the resource rent over the 3-dimensional 
effort vector $\vec{E}$.  

Area-specific equilibrium rent curves are produced via a grid search over 
fishing effort, assuming the 2016 version of the inverse 
demand curves $v_s$. Effort grids included 100 levels of coastwide effort 
$E = \sum_p E_p$, equally spaced from 1,000 - 100,000 hours of trawling. 
At each grid point, the allocation of total effort to each area is optimised
assuming that some fishing would occur in all areas, and that effort will be 
allocated to maximise rent. Under those assumptions, the optimal allocation of 
effort to each area is determined via Newton-Raphson optimisation of the 
allocation, numerically producing area-specific equilibrium curves.



### Optimal yield and reference points via stochastic simulation

While the equilibrium methods above provide exact values for $MSY$
reference points, they will approximate $MEY$ reference points when 
the relationship between catch and price varies. When demand
is dependent on a time-varying factor, such as household income as it 
is here (Appendix A), $E_{MEY}$ varies from year-to-year, as the unit-price 
varies, changing the total rent [@conrad1987natural]. To estimate 
the series of NPV maximising efforts for each area, $MEY$ reference points 
are estimated, and $MSY$ reference points validated, by stochastic 
simulation. The simulated DER complex is projected from 2016 
conditions and fishing effort is optimised under two alternative objective 
functions. The first maximises total multi-species catch over an 
80-year time horizon, i.e.
estimate $MSY_{MS}$
\begin{equation*}
C^{obj} = \sum_{t = 2017}^{2096} \sum_{s} \sum_{p}  C_{s,p,t},
\end{equation*}
to estimate $MSY_{MS}$. The second objective function estimates
$MEY$ by maximising the net present value (NPV) of the DER complex 
resource rent over the same time horizon, i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
\pi^{obj} = \sum_{t = 2017}^{2096} (1 + d)^{-(t - 2016)} \sum_{p} \left[  \left( \sum_s v_{s,t} C_{s,p,t} \right) - c_{p} E_{p,t} \right],
\end{equation*}
where $d$ is the annual discount rate (Table 2).

Simulations are repeated over 100 trials, where each trial involves
a unique realization of a stochastic future recruitment via the
stochastic recruitment series
\begin{align*}
R_{s,p,t} = \overline{R}_{s,p,t} \cdot e^{\sigma_{s,p} \cdot \epsilon_{s,p,t} - 0.5 \sigma^2_{s,p} }, \\
\end{align*}
which adds log-normal deviations to the expected Beverton-Holt 
recruitment at time $t$
\begin{equation}
\overline{R}_{s,p,t} = \frac{R_{s,p,0} \cdot 4h_{s,p} \cdot B_{s,p,t}}{B_{s,p,0} \cdot (1 - h_{s,p}) + (5h_{s,p} - 1)\cdot B_{s,p,t}},
\end{equation}
where life-history parameters taken from Table 1, $B_{s,p,t}$ the mature
female spawning biomass of species $s$ in area $p$ at time $t$,
$\epsilon_{s,p,t} \sim N(0,1)$ is the standardised 
recruitment process deviation, and $\sigma_{s,p}$ is the recruitment process 
deviation standard error. Note that recruitment process deviations are 
simulated for all stocks from earlier than 2017, because historical recruitment 
could not be estimated reliably past 2014. 


Equilibrium derivations of $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference points above are 
compared to distributions of effort, yield, and rent produced by 
the optimisations. Stochastic optima were defined as median values
over the 2040 - 2060 period under the yield ($C^{obj}$) and NPV 
$\pi^{obj}$ maximising objective functions, and denoted with an asterisk 
to differentiate from the equilibrium derivation, e.g. optimal efforts 
were $E^*_{MSY,MS,p}$ and $E^*_{MEY,p}$. Optima were calculated over 
2040 - 2060 to allow enough time for the effort to stabilise after any 
initial transient period, while also avoiding end effects (e.g., high 
fishing mortality) caused by a finite time horizon.

While total effort is unconstrained in the long-run, short-run 
(inter-annual) changes in coastwide effort were constrained to +/-20\% 
per year to reflect the potential for adding/subtracting new licenses in the 
fishery, as well as the lag time required for a capital investment (e.g., 
in new and larger vessels). While the effort is ultimately unbounded, the 
simulation treats the fishery as a single firm so it is possible 
that fishery profits will not be dissipated, unlike an open access 
fishery. The optimisation takes the same approach as the omniscient 
manager simulation in @johnson2021hierarchical.

## Harvest strategy performance

While optimal fishing efforts have theoretical value, it is difficult 
to control total fishing mortality via fishing effort alone,
since harvesters will continually adapt and improve harvest efficiency 
[@clark2002problem]. Instead, most contemporary fisheries employ output 
control quota systems involving a total allowable catch (TAC), set by 
taking the product of a target harvest rate and a biomass estimate.
This approach does not require controlling the total amount of effort (e.g. 
number of fishing vessels, sets, or trawl hours) via regulation. 
For example, an $MSY$ based harvest strategy will use $MSY$ reference 
points for optimal effort $E_{MSY}$ or fishing mortality $F_{MSY}$
to estimate an optimal harvest rate $U_{MSY}$. Then, catch limits are
derived from applying that harvest rate to estimates of biomass. 
Given the uncertainty in estimates of boimass, the risks and tradeoffs 
in fishery outcomes from repeated application of a harvest 
strategy are commonly tested in closed loop feedback simulation, 
or management strategy evaluation [@punt2016management].

The tradeoffs among harvest strategies based on $MSY_{SS}$, $MSY_{MS}$ 
and $MEY$ reference points applied to the DER complex are identified
via closed loop feedback simulations over an 80-year time
horizon. At each time step, TACs are set using a constant target
harvest rate based on the reference points being tested, i.e.
\[
TAC_{s,p,t} = \hat{B}_{s,p,t} \cdot U_{s,p},
\] 
where $\hat{B}_{s,p,t}$ is a biomass forecast for species $s$
in area $p$ at time $t$, and $U_{s,p}$ is the harvest rate derived
from either $MSY_{SS}$, $MSY_{MS}$, or $MEY$ reference points, or
from maximising long-run yield ($MSY_{MS}^*$) or NPV ($MEY^*$)
when stochasticity is explicitly taken into account. 
Uncertainty in biomass forecasts $\hat{B}_{s,p,t}$ is 
simulated via auto-correlated log-normal assessment errors 
\[
\hat{B}_{s,p,t} = B_{s,p,t}\cdot e^{\delta_{s,p,t}}
\] 
to approximate the observation uncertainty inherent in fish stock biomass
estimates. Parameters for the $\delta_{s,p,t}$ distribution are derived
from the distribution of estimation errors for a hierarchical multi-species 
surplus production assessment model applied to the simulated DER complex 
(see Appendix B for details) [@johnson2021hierarchical]. Once TACs are set, 
annual fishing effort is allowed to increase until at least one species' 
TAC in each area is fully utilised, after which the area is closed to fishing 
[@johnson2021hierarchical]. Interannual differences in catch are limited 
to +/-20\% for each stock-area combination, reflecting the limit on 
interannual differences in fishing effort used for the stochastic 
optimisation.

Fishery performance is measured by comparing the conservation and economic 
outcomes among the alternative harvest strategies (i.e., differing via their 
target harvest rates). Conservation performance is based on a comparison
of spawning biomass distributions (over all simulation replicates and
projection years) to fractions of single-species $B_{MSY,SS}$ over the 
period 2040 - 2060. Economic performance is measured as the NPV 
of the DER complex fishery over the whole 80-year time horizon under
each harvest strategy. Risk was 
measured via the 5th, 50th (median), and 95th percentiles of biomass and 
NPV distributions. The percentile $p^*$, or *Value-at-risk*-$p^*$ 
($VAR-p^*$), is a non-parametric definition of risk commonly used in 
economic analyses [@danielsson2011financial; @morganreuters1996riskmetrics].


## Sensitivity Analyses

Net present values and economic risks depend on the resource rents, 
which in turn depend on prices for each species (via inverse demand 
curves) and discount rates applied in NPV calculations. The sensitivity of 
stochastic optima under the rent objective ($\pi^{obj}$) is tested against 
demand and discount rate uncertainties in seven additional scenarios (Table 3). 
Three scenarios test alternative demand assumptions, specifically a perfectly 
elastic demand relationship, simulated by refitting demand curves with an 
infinite price elasticity of demand (i.e., zero price flexibility, Appendix 
A), and a constant demand over time by setting the growth in household income 
$\gamma = 0$. The remaining four scenarios test sensitivites to assumed 
discount rates $\delta$ and growth rates $\gamma$ of household income 
(Table 3). Alternative discount rates to the 5\% value used in the 
baseline simulation were alsot tested, and the alternative rates 
of growth in household income considered were +/-1 standard deviation 
of the recent mean rate of 3.9\%^[https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/government-finances/financial-economic-review/financial-economic-review-2020.pdf]
(Table 3).
