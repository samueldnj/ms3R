## Stock assessment model fit

The stock assessment model was fit to the biomass indices and compositional
data outlined in the methods. Because the main application of the simulation
model was to generate realistic catches in the projections under each 
scenario/objective function, we focused the evaluation of model fit on 
biomass indices and commercial age data. 

The fits to biomass indices were overall satisfactory. Fits for all series
were almost unbiased, with mean residuals at most 0.07 in absolute value. 
Despite low bias, there were significant trends in residuals for the modern 
commercial CPUE index for all QCS stocks, and WCVI Rock sole, as well as for 
the Hecate Strait assemblage survey for all three species (Figure 2); poor 
fits to these indices was not completely unexpected, as the modern trawl CPUE 
was a fishery dependent commercial catch-rate series with underlying 
targeting behaviour, while the fishery independent Hecate Strait Assemblage 
survey had a fixed station design with very large survey blocks. There were 
no trends in the residuals for the historical CPUE series, but this is due 
to the time-varying catchability applied to that series. Finally, the 
Synoptic survey residuals were unbiased and did not exhibit any 
significant trends.

**Age fits*

Biomass time series and single-species biological reference point estimates 
indicate that all DER complex stocks were in a healthy state in 2016 (Table 3). 
Three out of nine stocks exhibited 1-way trip dynamics (HSHG and QCS Dover, 
and QCS Rock, Figure 3), where biomass only depleted over the period 1956 - 
2016, while the remaining stocks showed signs of growth, usually after the mid 
1990s, which could indicate that the growth was more related to the switch 
between historical and modern commerical CPUE indices. Indeed, the two smaller 
English sole stocks (QCS and WCVI) exhibit large jumps in biomass as soon as 
the historical CPUE series ends, jumping almost all the way back to unfished 
levels in QCS. While these dynamics may indicate spurious recruitment dynamics
for these two stocks in the mid 1990s, the absolute size of the stocks is a 
very small proportion of the overall complex and so is is considered a minor
issue for the results of this paper.

Commercial catchability scalars were estimated as the average
log-residual between fishing mortality rates and trawl effort
for the modern trawl fleet.

### Multi-species maximum biological yield

The optimal harvest rate and spawning-stock biomass from the multi-species 
complex yield curves followed a similar pattern across the three areas 
(Figure 5). In all areas, the fishing effort maximising multi-species yield
for the area led to a slightly higher harvest rate for Dover sole when 
compared to the single-species optimal harvest rate. In contrast, the 
harvest rates maximising multi-species yield for both English and rock soles 
were slightly lower than the rates maximising single-species yield. In the 
HSHG area, where all three species had the highest biomasses, the 
multi-species optimal effort lay close to the single-species optimal 
effort, meaning that there was very little foregone yield for each species 
in order to maximise the total complex yield. In contrast, the other 
two areas each had a species with a yield curve that had a peak far to 
the right of the peaks of the other two curves, indicating a lower 
catchability scalar between effort and fishing mortality for English sole 
in QCS, and rock sole in WCVI. Although English (QCS) and rock (WCVI) soles 
are proportionally further under-exploited under the multi-species 
optimal effort than the least catchable species (rock sole) in HSHG, 
the yield lost to under-exploitation is trivial given the absolute 
size of each is an order of magnitude smaller than the larger
stocks in those areas.
