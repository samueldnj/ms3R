## Equilibrium multi-species $MSY$

Single-species reference points 


Multi-species yield-curves and the harvest rates that maximise multi-species 
complex yield reflect the spatial heterogeneity in species compositions 
and productivities. In HSHG and QCS areas, the optimal effort 
$E_{MSY,MS,p}$ produces lower optimal harvest rates for Dover sole and 
English sole when compared to single species optimal harvest rates, while 
Rock sole $U_{MSY,MS}$ harvest rates were 20\% - 30\% higher than Rock 
sole $U_{MSY,SS}$ ($U_{MSY,MS}/U_{MSY,SS}$, Table 4). In the WCVI area,
English sole $U_{MSY,MS}$ harvest rate is 8\% higher than English sole
$U_{MSY,SS}$, while Dover sole single- and multi-species optimal 
harvest rates are practically identical. Despite large differences in 
optimal harvest rates for some stocks, optimal yields $MSY_{SS}$ 
and $MSY_{MS}$ are similar, as lower harvest rates are applied
to larger equilibrium biomasses, and decreases from $MSY_{SS}$ 
to $MSY_{MS}$ were at most 5\% for any one stock. The total of $MSY_{MS}$ 
for the DER complex fishery was 5.26 kt, which was only 110t, or 3%, lower 
than the sum of single-species $MSY_{SS}$ yields.

Equilibrium annual rent from $MSY_{MS}$ also reflected DER complex 
spatial heterogeneity. Total coast-wide annual rent is around CAD 
\$278,000 $yr^{-1}$ (2016 dollars and demand curves) across the three 
stock areas. The area with the highest rent is HSHG, with an average
of almost CAD \$160,000 $yr^{-1}$, attained at the lowest effort of 
the three areas (Table 4), which is expected given that both catchability 
and total DER complex biomass is highest in HSHG. Rent for QCS (\$110,000
$yr^{-1}$) is dominated by a roughly equal mix of highly catchable Dover 
sole with lower own-price elasticity (i.e., more stable prices) and the
more valuable Rock sole, while the lowest rent (\$80,000 $yr^{-1}$)
occured in WCVI area, where catch is dominated by Dover sole,
which has an upper bound on unit price from the exogenous US catch.


## Equilibrium multi-species $MEY$

Like multi-species $MSY$, equilibrium resource rent relationships
with fishing effort also reflected the spatial heterogeneity of the DER 
complex, with total coastwide equilibrium rent at $MEY$ of approximately
CAD \$1.36 million $yr^{-1}$ (2016 dollars) (Table 4). Rent maximising 
fishing effort $E_{MEY}$ is estimated at slightly more than half of the 
effort level achieving $MSY_{MS}$ for all areas. The total difference 
in DER complex equilibrium catch between $MSY_{MS}$ and $MEY$ is 
around 1.1 kt, with individual stock catches lower than $MSY_{MS}$ by an 
average of 27\%, and a minimum 10% reduction in yield for QCS Rock sole. 

Similar to above, resource rent is highest in the HSHG area at the lowest 
effort, reflecting the higher biomass of all species in that area 
(Table 4). While optimal effort $E_{MEY}$ in QCS is about 20\% higher 
than in WCVI, the resource rent is about 50\% higher in the WCVI area. 
As with the $MSY_{MS}$ case, higher WCVI rent is caused by higher ratios 
of Dover sole biomass relative to English and Rock sole biomasses, higher 
catchability, and less elastic demand for Dover sole, which largely
compensate for higher fuel costs of fishing in WCVI. In short, WCVI
operates as an efficient, single-species fishery for Dover sole.

The rent maximising allocation of fishing effort among areas is 
independent of the total effort available, and instead depends mostly
on catchability scalars within an area and to a lesser extent on the 
unit price of each species. For any fixed level of coast-wide effort 
$E$, the rent maximising allocation to each area is always 
$\langle E_1, E_2, E_3 \rangle = \langle 0.25E, 0.42E, 0.33E \rangle$
for HSHG, QCS, and WCVI, respectively (Table 5). Allocation in each 
area $p$ is very close to the ratio $\rho_p$ of inverse average 
catchabilty scalars within an area $p$ to the sum of inverse average 
catchabilities, i.e.,
\begin{align*}
\rho_p &= \frac{1/\bar{q}^{(F)}_p}{\sum_p 1/\bar{q}^{(F)}_p}, \\
\bar{q}^{(F)}_p & = \frac{1}{3} \sum_s q^{(F)}_{s,p}. \\
\end{align*}
Further, the optimal equilbrium allocation is also very close to the 
$E_{MSY,MS}$ allocation (Table 5), but the pattern does not hold for 
stochastic simulations under time-varying demand, as explained below.


## Validating reference points via spatial effort optimisation

Stochastic optimisations spatially allocate fishing effort to each area 
in each year, either maximising catch to validate $MSY_{MS}$ reference 
points, or to maximising NPV, and estimate $MEY$ reference points that 
account for future changes in demand (Appendix A). 

As expected, stochasticity had no significant effect on $MSY^*_{MS}$ 
reference points. Insensitivity to stochasticity is because, aside
from recruitment process error, the major time-varying factor in 
projected DER complex dynamics is the unit price, and resource rents are 
not included in the objective function for $MSY^*_{MS}$. Stochastic 
approximations $E_{MSY,MS}^*$ are within 1 decimal place $E_{MSY,MS}$ in 
QCS and WCVI, and slightly higher for HSHG, which has a longer transitionary 
period before median dynamics settle close to the equilibria in each area 
(Figure 5). Similarly, harvest rate 
distributions under the stochastic optimisation centred almost exactly 
on $U_{MSY,MS}$ for all stocks (Figure 6), differing by approximately 
0.5\% of $U_{MSY,MS}$ (Table 5, $U^*_{MSY,MS}/U_{MSY,MS}$). 

Despite the insensitivity of the biological reference points to  
changes in demand, resource rents from catch maximisation in the 
projections are are dissipated completely (Table 6). Annual rents dropped 
by CAD \$1.3 million in the HSHG area, where the household income effect 
was highest (Appendix A), by \$220,000 in QCS, and \$360,000 in WCVI.
In all three areas, catch maximisation in the presence of dropping
demand made fishing the DER complex unprofitable (Table 6).

Changes in demand had a strong effect on NPV maximising effort series 
in stochastic simulations. As time goes on, GDP per capita
increases at a rate of 3.9% per year, lowering prices of all DER
complex species (Figure 2, grey lines). Given the revenue reduction,
the stochastic optimisation of DER complex fishery NPV reduces efforts 
in all three areas so that rents from fishing remain positive. 
The largest effort reductions are in HSHG and WCVI, where Dover
sole stocks are the largest, and the smallest change in the 
QCS area, where Dover sole dominated the biomass but Rock sole
was also a significant portion of the catch. Dependence on Dover sole 
is based on the assumed US west coast catches of around 8 kt (Figure 2 top
panel, vertical dashed line), which creates an upper bound on Dover sole 
near the minimum price for any year, no matter the BC catch. In contrast, 
there is no exogenous US west coast catch of Rock sole, allowing prices 
to rise more than Dover sole as efforts decrease in other areas (Figure 2).

Harvest rates maximising NPV (i.e., $U_{MEY}^*$) are 20\% - 40\% lower 
than the corresponding $U_{MEY}$ values (Table 6, $U^*_{MEY}/U_{MSY,MS}$). 
Such a reduction in harvest rates reflects declining unit prices, creating
conditions where effort (fishing costs) must be reduced so that rents 
remain positive. Unit prices decline as the demand curves shift downward 
with increasing income (Appendix A), which is usually explained as families 
switching to more expensive proteins as they become affordable [ref]. The 
decline in fishing efforts occurs after an initial development period, where 
effort increases to take advantage of higher initial prices before household 
incomes drive demand down (Figure 5). Despite consistently lower median 
harvest rates, the simulated distributions $U^*_{MEY}$ contain the 
corresponding equilibrium $U_{MEY}$ analogues for both QCS and WCVI, where 
Dover sole is at least 50\% of the catch (Figure 6). The reduction in market 
price also depresses annual rents expected during the 2040 - 2060 period, 
dropping by between 42\% (WCVI) and 67\% (HSHG) (Table 5).


## Conservation and economic performance via closed-loop feedback simulations


### Conservation performance

No tested target harvest rates pose any conservation risk 
when applied in closed loop simulations (Figure 7). For all harvest rates,
there was less than 5\% chance of pushing biomass below 40\% of 
single-species $B_{MSY,SS}$ (grey distributions, Figure 7), which is a
commonly accepted biomass limit reference point in Canadian fisheries 
[@DFO2006A-Harvest-Strat]. Only a small fraction of simulations show
biomass below 80\% of $B_{MSY,SS}$, which is acceptable conservation 
performance in any Canadian fishery [@DFO2006A-Harvest-Strat]. Further,
there was no significant difference between 2040 - 2060 biomass 
distributions for optimal harvest rates derived from equilibrium
and stochastic analyses, i.e., $U_{MSY,MS}$ and $U_{MSY,MS}^*$,
which came out slightly above the equilibrium $B_{MSY,MS}$ and
$B_{MSY,MS}^*$ values, respectively given in Tables 3 and 4. 

Single-species target harvest rates ($U_{MSY,SS}$) ignoring technical
interactions tend to fully exploit the species with the highest
catchability, i.e. Rock sole in HSHG and QCS, and English sole in WCVI,
making them the choke species under the single-species harvest strategy 
(Figure 8). Thus, single-species harves rates produced lower 
conservation risks than the multi-species harvest rates, because access to 
other species was restricted once the high-catchability species TAC
was attained. Therefore, TACs of other species were under-utilised and 
realised harvest rates were lower than their corresponding $U_{MSY,SS}$.
This led to 2040 - 2060 biomass being higher than the implicit
$B_{MSY,SS}$ target for the non-choke species.

The rent/NPV maximising harvest rates $U_{MEY}$ and $U^*_{MEY}$, and 
associated spawning biomasses $B_{MEY}$ and $B_{MEY}^*$, are inherently more 
conservative compared to the single- or multi-species $MSY$ values. 
Therefore, conservation risk is negligible when maximising resource 
rent and/or NPV. Furthermore, strategies based on stochastic optimisation
(i.e., $U_{MEY}^*$) are more conservative than strategies based on 
maximising 2016 equilibrium resource rent via $U_{MEY}$, given
that the $U_{MEY}^*$ is lower to preserve positive rents as demand 
decreases with increasing income (Figure 7). 


### Economic performance

Relative health of the DER complex stocks at the beginning of the
projection period provided conditions under which catch maximisation 
gave an economic windfall in the short term. While median DER complex 
fishery NPV under $MSY$ harvest rates was lower (Table 7), there was a 
short transient period during which annual rents climbed higher under 
$U_{MSY,MS}$ and $U_{MSY,SS}$ compared to either $U_{MEY}$ or $U_{MEY}^*$ 
harvest rates (Figure 9). After the initial peak, rents under the
multi-species and single-species $MSY$ harvest policies declined quickly,
becoming negative with 50\% probability around 2034 in the HSHG and WCVI 
areas, and around 2040 in the QCS area. Rents under $U_{MEY}^*$ and
$U_{MEY}$ followed a similar pattern, albeit with a lower peak sooner
in the projection, and a slower decline to become negative somewhere
between 2070 and 2090 (Figure 9). Declines in rent match the reduction
in fish prices as household income increases (Figure 2), with faster 
declines in WCVI and HSHG, as before, due to the proportionally smaller 
Rock sole biomass in those areas.

As expected, targeting $U_{MEY}$ and $U_{MEY}^*$ produced the highest NPV 
of the fishery (Table 7). The single-species harvest $MSY$ strategy had the
second highest NPV, and the multi-species $MSY$ strategies the lowest. 
While higher NPV from single-species than multi-species $MSY$ strategies
is somewhat counter to conventional wisdom, as choke effects are commonly
cited as an economic hardship, it is a case-specific phenomenon caused 
by the current healthy state of the DER complex, and the protective nature 
of the choke effects as outlined above leading to lower realised harvest 
rates and growth of non-choke species. Such conditions lead to higher 
CPUE, raising rents. However, like the multi-species harvest rates, 
rents under $U_{MSY,SS}$ quickly fell after the initial windfall (Figure 9), 
ultimately dissipating rents under both catch maximisation strategies.
Single-species $MSY$ rents declined more slowly in HSHG, given the choke 
effects and higher CPUE (Figure 9).

The Value-at-risk-5\% (i.e., $VAR-5\%$) gives the $5^{th}$ percentile
of the NPV distribution over all 100 replicates; in other words, the
lower bound of VAR-5\% gives an indication of the worst expected 
economic performance of a harvest strategy. For $U_{MSY,MS}$ and
$U_{MSY,MS}^*$, financial risk was quite high, with a VAR-5\% 
around \$570,000 (\$28,000 $yr^{-1}$, when adjusted for the discount 
rate of 5\%) under $U_{MSY,MS}$, and \$140,000 (\$7,000 $yr^{-1}$) 
when targeting $U_{MSY,MS}^*$ (Table 7). Neither NPV represents a 
viable fishery, given that the rent calculations did not include several 
sources of fishing costs. The single-species $U_{MSY,SS}$ harvest rates 
had lower risk, with a $VAR-5\%$ of around \$3 million (\$150,000
$yr^{-1}$; Table 7).

Variability, and the associated risk, of NPV was reduced overall under 
MEY related targets. Both $U_{MEY}$ and $U_{MEY}^*$ had very low financial 
risk, with the $VAR-5\%$ for both stochastic and equilibrium based
strategies at around \$11 million (\$550,000 $yr^{-1}$; Table 7), which
is higher than the $95^{th}$ percentile of either single- or multi-species
$MSY$ strategy. Further, the central 90\% of DER complex NPV under both MEY 
harvest rates ranged from around \$11 million at the low end to around
\$13 million at the high end. In contrast, the 5th and 95th percentiles 
under $MSY$ harvest rates differed by over \$5 million, indicating much 
higher uncertainty in future economic yield when attempting to maximise 
catch. Variability in economic yield when maximising catch or rents is 
similar to that observed in the stochastic optimisation, where efforts 
optimised to maximise rent had a much tighter distribution than efforts 
optimised to maximise DER complex total yield over the 80 year
projection (Figure 5).


## Sensitivity to economic assumptions

Demand curves under infinite PED and fixed household income are shown
in Figure 10. As expected, reducing the dependence of unit price (demand) 
on catch or household income leads to higher NPVs for the DER complex (Table
8). Significantly higher NPVs under the two infinite PED assumptions 
are based on no drop in price the at higher levels of catch (quantity 
supplied), which in turn encourage higher fishing effort (compare $E_{MEY}$
columns, Table 8 and 5). For the infinite PED and growing income
scenario, NPV is even higher because the relationship between Rock sole 
price and incomes was positive, encouraging more fishing over time 
(Appendix A). The NPV for the finite PED and growing income scenario was 
the lowest among the three demand curve sensitivities (Table 8).
Fixed incomes created a stable price/catch relationship that does not
reduce prices over time, allowing fishing effort levels to remain
higher over the projections.

Fishing effort time series for discount and growth rate sensitivity 
scenarios sorted into two groups. The high discount rate ($d = 0.1$) and 
low income growth ($\gamma = 0.02$) scenarios had very similar optimal 
effort dynamics, and the low discount rate ($d = 0.025$) and high income 
growth ($\gamma = 0.058$) scenarios were also very similar (Figure 11). 
Similarities in the high-discount/low-growth scenarios continued across 
most of the projection period after an inital difference in all areas, 
where the higher discount rate initially attracted more fishing effort to 
take advantage of high initial CPUE (Figure 11). For the low-discount/high-growth 
scenarios, median optimal effort time series differed by area. Median 
efforts converged early in QCS and WCVI, and stayed close for the entire 
projection. In contrast, the two scenarios diverged in the middle of the 
projection period in the HSHG area, where the lower discount rate scenario 
applied higher fishing effort, while the high income growth scenario dropped 
effort faster. Dropping effort as income grows is as expected, as a the unit 
price of all fish is dropping faster with the higher income growth rates, 
and the species composition in HSHG is roughly equal among the DER complex. 
The Dover sole effect meant rent was less sensitive to increased effort, 
so combined with a lower discount rate (i.e., more value for future 
rents), efforts could remain higher.
