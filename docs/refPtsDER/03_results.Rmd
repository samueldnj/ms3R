## Multi-species YPR reference points


### Multi-species maximum yield

Multi-species effort/yield relationships and the harvest rates that 
maximised multi-species complex yield followed a similar pattern in 
HSHG and QCS, but differed in WCVI (Figure 3, compare Tables 1 and 3). 
In HSHG and QCS areas, the optimal effort $E_{MSY,MS,p}$ produced lower 
optimal harvest rates for Dover sole and English sole (marginally) when 
compared to single species optimal harvest rates, while Rock sole
optimal harvest rates maximising multi-species yield were 20\% - 30\% 
higher than harvest rates maximising Rock sole yield alone (compare
$U_{MSY}$, Tables 1 and 3). In the WCVI area, $E_{MSY}$ led to a 5\%
higher English sole harvest rate when maximising DER complex yield than
English sole yield alone, while Dover sole harvest rates differed by 
less than a percentage point between the single-species and multi-species
optima, and Rock sole was slightly lower. Despite some large differences 
in optimal harvest rates, differences in $MSY_{SS}$ and $MSY_{MS}$ were subtle 
for all stocks, with a decrease of up to 5\% from $MSY_{SS}$ to $MSY_{MS}$ 
for any one stock. The total $MSY_{MS}$ for the DER complex fishery was
5.26 kt, which was only 110t, or 3%, lower than the sum of $MSY_{SS}$ 
yields, which are impossible to achieve at operating model equilibrium
given the technical interactions.

Annual resource rent at $MSY_{MS}$ assuming 2016 GDP per capita was around 
CAD \$278,000 across the three stock areas. The area with the highest 
rent was HSHG at almost CAD \$160,000, attained at the lowest effort of the 
three areas (Table 3), which is as expected since the catchability and
total DER complex biomass is highest in HSHG. WCVI was next, which is
dominated by highly catchable Dover sole, that also had relatively 
inelastic demand (i.e., stable prices). Finally, QCS is the lowest rent
area given the higher costs of fishing, low catchability of all species,
and roughly equal mix of Rock and Dover soles.


### Multi-species maximum economic yield

Maximum economic yield (annual resource rent in 2016 dollars) for the 
DER complex trawl fishery was around CAD $1.36 million (Table 3). Fishing 
effort achieving $MEY$ was just above half of the effort level achieving
$MSY_{MS}$ for all areas. Similarly, the optimal harvest rates for $MEY$ 
were around 40\% of the harvest rates for $MSY_{MS}$. The total difference 
in DER complex equilibrium catch between $MSY_{MS}$ and $C_{MEY}$ was 
approximately around 1.1 kt, with individual stock catches differing by an 
average of 27\%, with a minimum 10% difference for QCS Rock sole. 

Similar to above, resource rent was highest in the HSHG area at the lowest 
effort, reflecting the higher biomass of all species in that area 
(Table 4). While optimal effort $E_{MEY}$ in QCS was about 20\% higher 
than in WCVI, the resource rent was about 50\% higher in the WCVI area. 
As with the $MSY_{MS}$ case, higher WCVI rent is caused by the higher 
Dover sole biomass relative to English and Rock sols as well as higher 
commercial catchability and inelastic demand of Dover sole in the WCVI 
area, compensating for higher simulated fuel costs of fishing and 
increased rent in an area which was effectively a single-species fishery.


## Validation of reference points by effort optimisation

The most noticeable effect of the optimisation of projected
efforts was the change in demand. As time went on, GDP per capita
increased at a rate of 3.9% per year, lowering prices of all DER
complex species (Figure 2, grey lines). Given the revenue reduction,
the stochastic optimisation of DER complex fishery NPV reduced efforts 
in all three areas so that rents from fishing would remain positive, 
with the largest effort reductions in HSHG and WCVI, where Dover
sole stocks were the largest, and the smallest change was in the 
QCS area, where Dover sole dominated the biomass but Rock sole
was also a significant portion of the catch. Dependence on Dover sole 
is based on the assumed US west coast catches of around 8 kt (Figure 2 top
panel, vertical dashed line), which forced Dover sole prices to always 
be around the minimum price for any year, no matter the BC management 
action. In contrast, Rock sole had no exogenous US west coast catch,
allowing prices to rise more than Dover sole as efforts were 
decreased in other areas (Figure 2).

The reduction in effort when maximising NPV led to declining optimal 
fishing efforts for the majority of the projection period. The decline
came after an initial development period, where efforts increased to take 
advantage of the higher prices before household income drove demand down
(Figure 5). Correspondingly, $U_{MEY}^*$ harvest rates were consistently 
lower than the yield-per-recruit $U_{MEY}$ values by between 4 and 8 
percentage points, or 20\% - 40\% of the YPR values 
(compare harvest rates, Tables 3 and 4). Despite the consistently
lower median harvest rates, distributions of NPV maximising harvest
rates contained the YPR $U_{MEY}$ value for both QCS and WCVI, where
Dover sole was at least 50\% of the catch (Figure 6). This also 
depressed the annual rents expected during the 2040 - 2060 period, 
dropping by between 42\% (WCVI) and 67\% (HSHG) (Table 4).

As expected, the price reduction had no significant effect on the 
approximations to $MSY_{MS}$ reference points, because resource rents 
were not included in the catch maximising objective function. Stochastic 
approximations of $E_{MSY,MS}^*$ were within 1 decimal place for the 
QCS and WCVI areas, and slightly higher for the HSHG area, which had a 
longer transitionary period before median dynamics settled at the YPR 
optima in each area (Figure 5). Similarly, distributions of harvest
rates were centred almost exactly at the YPR optimal $U_{MSY,MS}$ 
value (Figure 6), differing by around half of a percentage point on 
average, or around 0.5\% of the YPR optimum (compare Tables 3 and 4). 
Despite insensitivity of the biological reference points to the dropping
prices, the resource rents produced by the equilibria were significantly
reduced. In the HSHG area where the effect of per capita GDP was the 
highest, the annual rents dropped by CAD $1.3 million to become
negative, making fishing the DER complex unprofitable in the HSHG area. 
Rents remained positive in the QCS and WCVI areas, but still dropped 
by 83\% (QCS) and 70\% (WCVI) when comparing median 2040 - 2060 values 
to the rent derived from the YPR analysis (compare Tables 3 and 4).


<!-- ## Effort allocations

The optimal allocation of fishing effort among areas was independent of 
the total effort, and appeared largely determined by the distribution
of commercial catchability scalars within an area. For any fixed level 
of coast-wide effort $E$, the optimal allocation was always 
$\langle E_1, E_2, E_3 \rangle = \langle 0.25E, 0.42E, 0.33E \rangle$.
This allocation was very close to the ratio $\rho_p$ of inverse 
average commercial catchabilty scalars within an area to the sum
of inverse average catchabilities (Table 5 $1/\bar{q}^{(F)}$), defined by
\begin{align*}
\rho_p &= \frac{1/\bar{q}^{(F)}_p}{\sum_p 1/\bar{q}^{(F)}_p}, \\
\bar{q}^{(F)}_p & = \frac{1}{3} \sum_s q^{(F)}_{s,p}, \\
\end{align*}
indicating that the allocation is likely fixed based on $q^{F}_{s,p}$ 
values, and the price elasticity of demand $\lambda_s$ has a minor effect,
as the allocation was similar when $\lambda_s = \infty$ (Table S1).
The optimal allocation was also similar, but less so, to the relative 
allocation of effort $E_{MSY,MS,p}$ when maximising catch (Table 5).

## Applying optimal harvest rates in practice


### Conservation performance

None of the target harvest rates posed any conservation risk under 
when applied in closed loop simulations (Figure 7). For all harvest rates,
there was less than 5\% chance of pushing biomass below 40\% of 
single-species $B_{MSY,SS}$ (grey distributions, Figure 7), and only a 
small chance of pushing biomass below 80\% of $B_{MSY,SS}$, which would be 
acceptable conservation performance in any Canadian fishery
[@DFO2006A-Harvest-Strat]. For $U_{MSY,MS}$ and $U_{MSY,MS}^*$ harvest 
rates, there was no significant difference
between 2040 - 2060 biomass distributions, which came out slightly
above the equilibrium $B_{MSY,MS}$ and $B_{MSY,MS}^*$ values given in 
Tables 3 and 4. 

As expected, single-species $U_{MSY,SS}$ harvest rates produced lower 
conservation risk then the multi-species harvest rates. Single-species
target harvest rates ignored technical interactions, so tended to fully 
exploit the species with the highest catchability (choke species), i.e.,
Rock Sole in HSHG and QCS, and English Sole in WCVI (Figure 8). Access to 
the other species with under-utilised TAC was then restricted by the fully 
utilised choke species TAC. This led to 2040 - 2060 biomass being
higher than the implicit $B_{MSY,SS}$ target for the non-choke species.


Similarly, $B_{MEY}$ and $B_{MEY}^*$ values were always higher than
$B_{MSY,MS}$ and $B_{MSY,SS}$ values. Therefore, conservation risk was 
always lower under $U_{MEY}^*$ and $U_{MEY}$. Differences in 2040 - 2060
biomass distributions were larger for $U_{MEY}^*$ and $U_{MEY}$ harvest
rates then the $U_{MSY,MS}$ case, given the price reductions for all
species over the projection period. Biomass when targeting the stochastic
optimal $U_{MEY}^*$ harvest rate was between 10\% and 20\% lower than 
the biomass when targeting the YPR derived $U_{MEY}$ (Figure 7). 




### Economic performance

Relative health of the DER complex stocks at the beginning of the
projection period provided conditions under which catch maximisation 
gave an economic windfall in the short term. While median NPV of the DER 
complex fishery under MSY harvest rates was lower (Table 6), there was a 
short transitionary period where annual rents climbed higher under 
$U_{MSY,MS}$ and $U_{MSY,SS}$ than under either $U_{MEY}$ or $U_{MEY}^*$ 
harvest rates (Figure 9). After the initial peak, rents under the
multi-species and single-species MSY harvest policies declined quickly,
becoming negative with 50\% probability around 2034 in the HSHG and WCVI 
areas, and around 2040 in the QCS area. Rents under $U_{MEY}^*$ and
$U_{MEY}$ followed a similar pattern, albeit with a lower peak sooner
in the projection, and a slower decline to become negative somewhere
between 2070 and 2090 (Figure 9). Declines in rent match the reduction
in fish prices as household income increases (Figure 2), with faster 
declines in WCVI and HSHG, as before, due to the proportionally smaller 
Rock sole biomass in those areas.

As expected, targeting $U_{MEY}$ and $U_{MEY}^*$ produced the highest NPV 
of the fishery (Table 6). The median NPV for MEY harvest rates was 
$11 - $12 million, or an average of about $550,000 per annum in undiscounted
rent, compared to $5 million (approx $250,000 per annum) for $U_{MSY,SS}$ 
and around $3 million ($150,000 per annum) for $U_{MSY,MS}$ and
$U_{MSY,MS}^*$. While higher NPV under a single-species harvest
policy is counter to conventional wisdom, it is a case-specific 
phenomenon caused by the current healthy state of the DER complex, and
the protective nature of the choke effects leading to growth, and
therefore higher CPUE, of the non-choke species. However, like the 
multi-species harvest rates, rents under $U_{MSY,SS}$ quickly fell
after the initial windfall, declining more slowly in HSHG given
the choke effects and higher CPUE (Figure 9).

Tail risk was quite high for all of the catch maximising harvest
rates. The $VAR-5\%$ of NPV for the multi-species $MSY$ harvest
rates was \$570,000 for the 80 year projection, or around \$28,000 per 
annum, under $U_{MSY,MS}$, and \$140,000 (\$7,000 per annum) when
targeting $U_{MSY,MS}^*$; neither value represents a viable fishery,
given that our rent calculation does not include several sources of fishing
costs. The single-species MSY harvest rates had lower tail risk than
$U_{MSY,MS}$ and $U_{MSY,MS}^*$, with a $VAR-5\%$ of around \$3 million 
(\$150,000 per annum).


Variability, and any associated risk, of NPV was reduced overall under 
MEY related targets. Both $U_{MEY}$ and $U_{MEY}^*$ had very low tail 
risk, with the $VAR-5\%$ for both stochastic and YPR rates at around
\$11 million (\$550,000 per annum). Further, the central 95\% of the 
NPV under both MEY harvest rates ranged from around \$11 million to 
around \$13 million, differing by around \$2 million. In contrast, the
5th and 95th percentiles under MSY harvest rates differed by over \$5 
million, indicating much higher uncertainty in future economic yield
when attempting to maximise catch. Variability in economic yield when
maximising catch or rents is similar to that observed in the stochastic 
optimisation, where efforts optimised to maximise rent had a much tighter 
distribution than efforst optimised to maximise DER complex yield (Figure 5).


## Sensitivity to economic assumptions

Demand curves under infinite PED and fixed household income are shown
in Figure 10. As expected, reducing the dependence of unit price (demand) 
on catch or household income led to higher NPVs for the DER complex (Table
8). Higher NPVs under the infinite PED assumptions were based on
no drop in price the at higher levels of catch (quantity supplied), 
which in turn encouraged higher expenditures of fishing effort (compare
Table 8 and 5). In contrast, the higher NPVs under the fixed income
assumption were an effect of the stable price/catch relationship, which
also encouraged higher outlays of fishing effort as the value of the
fishery did not decline due to the constant household incomes. Both
infinite PED and constant houshold income had roughly the same NPV, efforts
and rents (Table 8). However, when both assumptions were combined, the 
effects were almost additive (Table 8, Infinite PED, Fixed Income scenario).


[**INCORRECT RESULTS BELOW - AWAITING RERUNS**]

In terms of future optimal effort allocation, discount and growth rate 
sensitivity scenarios sorted into two groups. The high discount rate 
($d = 0.1$) and low income growth ($\gamma = 0.02$) scenarios had very 
similar optimal effort dynamics, and the low discount rate ($d = 0.025$)
and high income growth ($\gamma = 0.058$) scenarios were also very similar.
Similarities in the high-discount/low-growth scenarios continued across
most of the projection period after an inital difference, where the higher
discount rate led to more fishing effort initially to take advantage
of high initial CPUE. 

For the low-discount/high-growth scenario, the level of similarity in
median optimal effort was area-dependent. That is, the median efforts 
converged early in QCS and WCVI and stayed close for the entire projection, 
but had an intermediate divergent period in HSHG, wehre the lower
discount rate scenario applied higher fishing effort, while the high
income growth scenario dropped effort faster. Similar to the effort
allocations in the $E_{MEY}^*$ stochastic optimisation, the divergent
behaviour in HSHG is caused by the species composition, with HSHG dominated
by Dover sole, for which demand did not depend on household income,
and was fairly insensitive to changes in catch given the high exogenous
US West coast catch level [**UDPATE WITH NEW RESULTS**]. The Dover sole 
effect meant rent was less sensitive to increased effort, so combined with
a lower discount rate (i.e., more value for future rents), efforts
could remain higher.
