## Stock assessment model fit

The stock assessment model was fit to the biomass indices and compositional
data outlined in the methods. Because the main application of the simulation
model was to generate realistic catches in the projections under each 
scenario/objective function, we focused the evaluation of model fit on 
biomass indices and commercial age data. 

The fits to biomass indices were overall satisfactory. Fits for all series
were almost unbiased, with mean residuals at most 0.07 in absolute value. 
Despite low bias, there were significant trends in residuals for the modern 
commercial CPUE index for all QCS stocks, and WCVI Rock sole, as well as for 
the Hecate Strait assemblage survey for all three species (Figure 4); poor 
fits to these indices was not completely unexpected, as the modern trawl CPUE 
was a fishery dependent commercial catch-rate series with underlying 
targeting behaviour, while the fishery independent Hecate Strait Assemblage 
survey had a fixed station design with very large survey blocks. There were 
no trends in the residuals for the historical CPUE series, but this is due 
to the time-varying catchability applied to that series. Finally, the 
Synoptic survey residuals were unbiased and did not exhibit any 
significant trends.

**Age fits**

**MCMC diagnostics (Rhats, bulk and tail ESS)**

Biomass time series and single-species biological reference point estimates 
indicate that all DER complex stocks were in a healthy state in 2016 (Table 3). 
Three out of nine stocks exhibited 1-way trip dynamics (HSHG and QCS Dover, 
and QCS Rock, Figure 5), where biomass only depleted over the period 1956 - 
2016, while the remaining stocks showed signs of growth, usually after the mid 
1990s, which could indicate that the growth was more related to the switch 
between historical and modern commerical CPUE indices. Indeed, the two smaller 
English sole stocks (QCS and WCVI) exhibit large jumps in biomass in 1996/1997,
right as the historical trawl CPUE ends and modern trawl CPUE begins, jumping 
almost all the way back to unfished levels in QCS. While these dynamics may 
indicate spurious recruitment dynamics for these two stocks in the mid 
1990s, the absolute size of the stocks is a very small proportion of the 
overall complex and so is is considered a minor issue for the results of 
this paper.

Commercial catchability scalars for the modern trawl fleet were estimated
as the mean log-residual between fishing mortality and trawl effort [eqref].
Estimates were similar among species in the HSHG (0.022 - 0.026) and 
QCS (0.014 - 0.016) areas, but more different in WCVI (0.012 - 0.025)
(Table X). Estimates of fishing mortality were distributed evenly around
the mean catchability relationship for the 1996 - 2016 period, with the
exception of some outliers in WCVI at around 22 thousand hours of trawling
in 1996, where Rock sole's observed relationship was almost twice the 
mean, and Dover and English were about half as catchable (Figure 6). These 
outliers may show a non-linear relationship between effort and mortality, 
counter to our assumption but also a realistic case, either from improved 
targeting  behaviour (increasing relationship, e.g., Rock sole), or 
over-depletion (decreasing relationship, e.g., Dover and English soles), 
but these data are not powerful enough to draw any such conclusions. Given
the closure of the BC trawl fishery in 1995 due to overfishing concerns
and poor reporting, it is likely that the outliers show overdepletion 
and/or poor record keeping at the beginning of the at-sea observer program.

Correlation in recruitment deviations

## DER complex time-varying inverse demand curves

Fitting the time varying inverse demand curve model (Appendix B) to
ex-vessel unit price data showed that all three DER complex species
had relatively elastic demand (i.e., $\lambda_s > 1$ for all species
$s$; Figure 6, demand curves). Over time, reference prices steadily 
dropped from around $1 per kg in 2006 to lows around $0.50/kg - $0.75/kg
in 2011/2012 (Figure 6, Price time series), before increasing for 2-3 
years, with English sole reaching its maximum recorded ex-vessel and 
reference price estimate in 2013. In 2014, all three species reference 
prices dropped again and converged around $0.50/kg, before increasing 
again to the some of the highest observed prices in 2015 (Dover), 
or 2016 (English, Rock). As expected from the reference point and
biomass estimates (Table 3) observed ex-vessel prices are, with the
exception of Dover sole in 2006, above the reference price, indicating
that catches are generally below the coast-wide maximum sustainable
yield for each species. Observed prices for English and Rock sole were
generally much higher then reference prices, which is again expected
given the price elasticity of demand is much higher for Dover sole,
leading to a flatter demand curve (Figure 6).

TODO: SCALE deltas by their standard deviation (post-fit estimate)

The blocks of decreasing and increasing reference prices are reflected
in the random walk deviations (Figure 6, RW deviations). Early in the 
period $\delta_{s,t} < 0$ for all three species, becoming positive 
for 2010-2013, and so on. While random walks were closed to unbiased 
with mean deviations of at most 0.08 in absolute value, random walk 
jumps became more variable over time, with devaitions larger than 
1.0 only occuring in the last three years of the period. While the
blocking and shift in variation could signal model misspecification 
(e.g., some latent unmodeled process), they could also be caused by 
the small sample size.

## Steady-state reference points

### Multi-species maximum yield

Multi-species effort/yield relationships, and the harvest rates that 
maximised multi-species complex yield, followed a similar pattern in 
HSHG and QCS, but differed in WCVI (Figure 8, compare Tables 3 and 4). 
In HSHG and QCS areas, the optimal effort $E_{MSY,p}$ produced lower 
optimal harvest rates for Dover sole and English sole (marginally) when 
compared to single species optimal harvest rates, while Rock sole
optimal harvest rates maximising multi-species yield were 20\% - 30\% 
higher than harvest rates maxmising Rock sole yield alone (compare
$U_{MSY}$, Tables 3 and 4). In the WCVI area, $E_{MSY}$ led to a 5\%
higher English sole harvest rate when maximising DER complex yield than
English sole yield alone, while Dover sole harvest rates differed by 
less than a percentage point between the single-species and multi-species
optima, and Rock sole was slightly lower. Despite some large differences 
in optimal harvest rates, differences in MSY_SS and MSY_MS were subtle 
for all stocks, with a decrease of at most 5\% from MSY_SS to MSY_MS
to a total catch of XX.

Resource rent at MSY was around $620,000 CAD summed across the three
areas. The area with the highest resource rent was HSHG, attained at
the lowest effort of the three areas (Table 3). The QCS and WCVI
areas both had roughly equal equilibrium resource rents at MSY, with
QCS around 9% higher rent at 11% higher fishing effort.


### Multi-species maximum economic yield

Maximum economic yield (resource rent) for the DER complex trawl fishery 
was around $1.58m CAD (Table 4). Fishing effort achieving MEY was about 
one third of the effort level achieving MSY_MS for all areas. Similarly, 
the optimal harvest rates for MEY were around 40\% of the harvest rates 
for MSY_MS. Despite the large drop in effort and harvest rates, 
catch differences were small given the higher equilibrium biomass at 
the lower fishing effort. The total difference in DER complex 
equilibrium catch between $MSY_{MS}$ and $C_{MEY}$ was approximately 
1.1 kt, with individual stock catches differing by an average of [X\%], 
with a minimum difference of 9\% for HSHG Rock sole. 

Once again, MEY was highest in the HSHG area at the lowest effort,
reflecting the higher biomass of all species in that area (Table 4). While
$E_{MEY}$ in QCS was higher than in WCVI by a similar proportion to the
corresponding $E_{MSY}$ values, the resource rent was about 40\% higher in 
the WCVI area. The higher WCVI rent is thanks largely to the higher 
Dover sole biomass in the WCVI, along with a higher price elasticity 
of demand for Dover sole, which increased the landed value of Dover sole 
and compensated for the higher costs of fishing in the WCVI area.

[Reference to supplemental material for base run without PED?]

At the assumed fuel costs, the resource rents of the DER complex fishery 
are dependent on technical interactions to remain positive. While it is 
profitable to fish each species individually at low effort levels, as 
effort increases at least one revenue curve drops below the marginal 
cost line before $E_{MEY}$ is reached (Figure 9). 

The optimal allocation of fishing effort among areas was independent of 
the total effort. For any fixed level of coast-wide effort $E$, the 
optimal allocation was always 
$\langle E_1, E_2, E_3 \rangle = \langle 0.25E, 0.42E, 0.33E \rangle$.
This allocation was almost identical to the ratio of inverse average 
commercial catchabilty $q^{F}_{s,p}$ values (Table 4), and similar to 
the proportion of total effort allocated at $E_{MSY}$, indicating that 
the allocation is likely fixed based on $q^{F}_{s,p}$ values, and 
the price elasticity of demand has at most a minor effect.



## Dynamic reference points

[Show effort series plots - talk about variability?]

Distributions of harvest rates from 2040 - 2060 were similar within 
objective functions and across correlation scenarios (Figure 10). For 
objective functions that maximsed total catch, median harvest rates 
were almost identical to steady-state optimal harvest rates (Table 4),
while distributions showed high variability. While variability of 
resource rent maximising harvest rates under was lower, distributions
still intersected with steady-state $U_{MEY}$ values, and median
dynamic harvest rates were between 7\% and 40\% higher than steady-state 
optimal harvest rates.

As expected, correlation had a larger effect on the variance of harvest 
rate distributions than on the median harvest rates, as correlation affects
the shape of distributions more than the scale. Median harvest rates were
insensitive to the correlation scenario, differing by at most a percentage
point (compare Table 5 and Tables S1 - S3). Correlation effects were most 
noticeable (i.e., visually) under recruitment correlation, and less 
noticeable under price correlation (Figure 10). Insensitivity to price 
correlation is likely partially caused by the bounds placed on fish prices 
to avoid unrealistically high net-present values of resource rents under 
some simulation replicates. 
[**concrete differences in percentiles**]
 
Median resource rents under both objective functions was higher than 
the steady-state solution (compare resource rents columns, Tables 4 and 
5), despite almost identical efforts and harvest rates under the
catch maximising objective function. When maximising catch under
the stochastic optimisation, median rent was over three times 
the steady state estimate in HSHG, around two times in QCS, and 9\% lower
in WCVI. The rent maximising objective function also produced
higher resource rents in general, extracting 88\% higher rents in HSHG, 
50\% higher in QCS, and 14\% higher in WCVI. Higher resource rents in
general are caused by the [**ability of prices to climb higher through price
variation than under steady state, which relies on price elasticity of 
demand alone to increase surplus. Further, there is a maximum price of 
200\% of the historically observed max, but a minimum of 50\% of the 
historically observed min price, putting some asymmetry in the price 
dist after integrating over 100 possible futures. Testing using
deterministic runs will show whether this is true.**] 

While most median quantities were insensitive to correlation, 
there were some notable differences in median resource rents in
the HSHG area when correlation was added to price. 


## Targeting optimal harvest rates in practice

We present results from the closed loop simulation under perfect
information and simulated assessment errors for three harvest rates
under each correlation scenario, namely the steady state $U_{MSY,MS}$ 
and $U_{MEY}$ estimates, and the dynamic approximation to $U_{MEY}$. 
Given that median harvest rates for dynamic approximations to 
$U_{MSY,MS}$ were almost identical to the steady state solution, we 
do not present results from closed loop simulations that applied 
dynamic $U_{MSY,MS}$ harvest rates to DER complex stocks. Although 
differences in steady-state and median dynamic $U_{MEY}$ harvest 
rates were not statistically significant, we present results based on 
applying both the steady state $U_{MEY}$ and its dynamic approximation 
under the full price and recruitment correlation (**corrRecPrice**) 
scenario. Both are presented because fishery management decisions are 
often made based on mean or median stock assessment outputs, with 
variability sometimes ignored or used to justify additional precautionary 
controls. However, the four dynamic approximations to $U_{MEY}$ differed 
by at most one percentage point across the four scenarios, so one 
approximation will give sufficiently representative results.
