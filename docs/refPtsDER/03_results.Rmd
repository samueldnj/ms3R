## Equilibrium multi-species $MSY$

Multi-species yield-curves and the harvest rates that maximise multi-species 
complex yield reflect the spatial heterogeneity in species compositions 
and productivities (Figure 3). In HSHG and QCS areas, the optimal effort 
$E_{MSY,MS,p}$ produces lower optimal harvest rates for Dover sole and 
English sole when compared to $U_{MSY,SS}$, while Rock sole $U_{MSY,MS}$ 
harvest rates were 20\% - 30\% higher than Rock 
sole $U_{MSY,SS}$ ($U_{MSY,MS}/U_{MSY,SS}$, Table 4). In the WCVI area,
English sole $U_{MSY,MS}$ harvest rate is 8\% higher than English sole
$U_{MSY,SS}$, while Dover sole $U_{MSY,MS}$ and $U_{MSY,SS}$ are 
practically identical. Despite large differences in 
optimal harvest rates for some stocks, optimal yields $MSY_{SS}$ 
and $MSY_{MS}$ are similar, as lower harvest rates are applied
to larger equilibrium biomasses, and decreases from $MSY_{SS}$ 
to $MSY_{MS}$ were at most 5\% for any one stock. The total of $MSY_{MS}$ 
for the DER complex fishery was 5.26 kt, which was only 110t, or 3%, lower 
than the sum of single-species $MSY_{SS}$ yields.

Annual equilbrium rent from $MSY_{MS}$ also reflected spatial heterogeneity 
in the DER complex. Total coast-wide annual rent is around CAD 
\$278,000 $yr^{-1}$ (2016 dollars) across the three 
stock areas. The area with the highest rent is HSHG, with an average
of almost CAD \$160,000 $yr^{-1}$, attained at the lowest effort of 
the three areas (Table 4), which is expected given that both catchability 
and total DER complex biomass is highest in HSHG. Rent for QCS (\$110,000
$yr^{-1}$) is dominated by a roughly equal mix of highly catchable Dover 
sole with lower own-price elasticity (i.e., more stable prices) and the
more valuable Rock sole, while the lowest rent (\$80,000 $yr^{-1}$)
occured in WCVI area, where catch is dominated by Dover sole,
which has an upper bound on unit price from the exogenous US catch.


## Equilibrium multi-species $MEY$

Like multi-species $MSY$, equilibrium resource rent curves also 
reflected the spatial heterogeneity of the DER complex (Figure 4), 
with total coastwide equilibrium rent at $MEY$ of approximately
CAD \$1.36 million $yr^{-1}$ (2016 dollars) (Table 4). Rent maximising 
fishing effort $E_{MEY}$ is estimated at slightly more than half of the 
effort level achieving $MSY_{MS}$ for all areas. The difference 
in total equilibrium catch between $MSY_{MS}$ and $MEY$ is 
around 1.1 kt, with individual stock catches lower under $MEY$ than
$MSY_{MS}$ by an average of 27\%.

Similar to the above, resource rent is highest in the HSHG area at the 
lowest effort, reflecting the higher biomass of all species in that area 
(Table 4). While optimal effort $E_{MEY}$ in QCS is about 20\% higher 
than in WCVI, the resource rent is about 50\% higher in the WCVI area. 
As with the $MSY_{MS}$ case, higher WCVI rent is caused by higher ratios 
of Dover sole biomass relative to English and Rock sole biomasses, higher 
catchability, and less elastic demand for Dover sole, which largely
compensate for higher fuel costs of fishing in WCVI and lower
price of Dover sole. In short, WCVI operates as an efficient, 
single-species fishery for Dover sole.

The rent maximising allocation of fishing effort among areas is 
independent of the total effort available, and instead depends mostly
on catchability scalars within an area and to a lesser extent on the 
unit price of each species. For any fixed level of coast-wide effort 
$E$, the rent maximising allocation to each area is always 
$\langle E_1, E_2, E_3 \rangle = \langle 0.25E, 0.42E, 0.33E \rangle$
for HSHG, QCS, and WCVI, respectively (Table 5), which appears related
to catchability (Appendix C).


## Validating reference points via spatial effort optimisation

Stochastic optimisations spatially allocate fishing effort to each area 
in each year, either maximising catch to validate $MSY_{MS}$ reference 
points, or maximising NPV to estimate $MEY$ reference points that 
account for future changes in demand (Appendix A). 

As expected, stochasticity had no significant effect on $MSY^*_{MS}$ 
reference points. Insensitivity of $MSY_{MS}$ reference points to 
recruitment stochasticity is because the major time-varying factor in 
projected DER complex dynamics is the unit price, which are not included 
in the $MSY^*_{MS}$ objective function. Stochastic approximations
$E_{MSY,MS}^*$ are within 1 decimal place $E_{MSY,MS}$ in 
QCS and WCVI, and slightly higher for HSHG, which has a longer transitionary 
period before median dynamics settle close to the equilibria in each area 
(Figure 5). Similarly, harvest rate 
distributions under the stochastic optimisation centred almost exactly 
on $U_{MSY,MS}$ for all stocks (Figure 6), differing by approximately 
0.5\% of $U_{MSY,MS}$ (Table 5, $U^*_{MSY,MS}/U_{MSY,MS}$). 

Despite the insensitivity of the biological reference points to changes 
in demand, resource rents from catch maximisation in the 
projections declined to less than zero (Table 6). Rents
declined due to DER complex species being inferior goods. Annual rents 
dropped by CAD \$1.3 million in the HSHG area, where the negative income 
elasticity was highest (Appendix A), by \$220,000 in QCS, and \$360,000 
in WCVI. In all three areas, catch maximisation in the presence of dropping
demand made fishing the DER complex unprofitable (Table 6).

Negative income elasticity had a strong effect the effort series 
maximising NPV in stochastic simulations. As time goes on, household income
increases at a rate of 3.9% per year, so negative income elasticity
reduces prices of all DER complex species. Given the revenue reduction,
the stochastic optimisation of the NPV for the DER complex fishery
reduces efforts in all three areas so that rents from fishing remain 
positive through own-price elasticity. The largest effort reductions are 
in HSHG and WCVI, where Dover sole stocks are the largest, and the smallest 
change is in the QCS area, where Dover sole dominated the biomass but Rock 
sole was also a significant portion of the catch. Dependence on Dover sole 
is based on the assumed US west coast catches of around 8 kt (Figure 2 top
panel, vertical dashed line), which creates an upper bound on Dover sole 
near the minimum price for any year, irrespective of the BC catch. In contrast, 
there is no exogenous US west coast catch of Rock sole, allowing prices 
to rise more than Dover sole as efforts decrease in other areas (Figure 2).

Harvest rates maximising NPV (i.e., $U_{MEY}^*$) are 20\% - 40\% lower 
than the corresponding $U_{MEY}$ values under the 2016 version
of the inverse demand curves (Table 6, $U^*_{MEY}/U_{MSY,SS}$). 
Reduced harvest rates in the stochastic optimisation reflect the
negative income elasticity, creating conditions where effort (fishing costs) 
must be reduced so that rents remain positive. Unit prices decline as the 
demand curves shift downward with increasing income (Appendix A), which is 
usually explained as switching to more expensive proteins as they become 
affordable [@dey2011multistage]. The decline in fishing efforts occurs 
after an initial development period, where effort increases to take advantage 
of higher initial prices before household 
incomes drive demand down (Figure 5). Despite consistently lower median 
harvest rates, the simulated distributions $U^*_{MEY}$ contain the 
corresponding equilibrium $U_{MEY}$ analogues for both QCS and WCVI, where 
Dover sole is at least 50\% of the catch (Figure 6). The reduction in market 
price also depresses annual rents expected during the 2040 - 2060 period, 
dropping these by 42\% (WCVI) to 67\% (HSHG) (Table 5).


## Conservation and economic performance via closed-loop feedback simulations


### Conservation performance

None of the target harvest rates we tested pose any conservation risk 
when applied in closed loop simulations (Figure 7). For all harvest rates,
there was less than a 5\% chance of pushing biomass below 40\% of 
$B_{MSY,SS}$ (grey distributions, Figure 7), which is a
commonly accepted limit reference point for biomass in Canadian fisheries 
[@DFO2006A-Harvest-Strat]. Only a small fraction of simulations show
biomass below 80\% of $B_{MSY,SS}$, which is acceptable conservation 
performance in any Canadian fishery [@DFO2006A-Harvest-Strat]. Further,
there was no significant difference between 2040 - 2060 biomass 
distributions for optimal harvest rates derived from equilibrium
and stochastic analyses, i.e., $U_{MSY,MS}$ and $U_{MSY,MS}^*$,
which came out slightly above the equilibrium $B_{MSY,MS}$ and
$B_{MSY,MS}^*$ values, respectively given in Tables 3 and 4. 

Target harvest rates for single-species ($U_{MSY,SS}$), which ignore 
technical interactions, tend to fully exploit the species with the highest
catchability, i.e. Rock sole in HSHG and QCS, and English sole in WCVI,
making them the choke species under the single-species harvest strategy 
(Figure 8). Thus, single-species harvest rates produced lower 
conservation risks than the multi-species harvest rates, because access to 
other species was restricted once the high-catchability species TAC
was attained. Therefore, TACs of other species were under-utilised and 
realised harvest rates were lower than their corresponding $U_{MSY,SS}$.
This led to 2040 - 2060 biomass being higher than the implicit
$B_{MSY,SS}$ target for the non-choke species.

The $U_{MEY}$ and $U^*_{MEY}$ harvest rates that maximise rent, and 
associated spawning biomasses $B_{MEY}$ and $B_{MEY}^*$, are inherently 
more conservative compared to the $U_{MSY,SS}$ and $U_{MSY,MS}$. 
Therefore, conservation risk is negligible when maximising resource 
rent. Furthermore, strategies based on stochastic optimisation
(i.e., $U_{MEY}^*$) are more conservative than strategies based on 
maximising 2016 resource rent via $U_{MEY}$, given the negative
income elasticity (Figure 7). 


### Economic performance

Relative health of the DER complex stocks at the beginning of the
projection period provide conditions under which catch maximisation 
gave an economic windfall in the short term. While median DER complex 
fishery NPV under $MSY$-based harvest strategies was lower than
under $MEY$-based strategies (Table 7), there was a 
short transient period during which annual rents climbed higher under 
$U_{MSY,MS}$ and $U_{MSY,SS}$ compared to either $U_{MEY}$ or $U_{MEY}^*$ 
harvest rates (Figure 9). After the initial peak, rents under the
multi-species and single-species $MSY$ harvest policies declined quickly,
becoming negative with 50\% probability around 2034 in the HSHG and WCVI 
areas, and around 2040 in the QCS area. Rents under $U_{MEY}^*$ and
$U_{MEY}$ followed a similar pattern, albeit with a lower peak sooner
in the projection, and a slower decline to become negative somewhere
between 2070 and 2090 (Figure 9). Declines in rent match the reduction
in fish prices as household income increases (Figure 2), with faster 
declines in WCVI and HSHG, as before, due to the proportionally smaller 
Rock sole biomass in those areas.

As expected, targeting $U_{MEY}$ and $U_{MEY}^*$ produced the highest NPV 
of the fishery (Table 7). The $MSY_{SS}$-based harvest strategy had the
second highest NPV, and the $MSY_{MS}$-based strategies the lowest. 
While higher NPV under single-species $MSY$ strategies is somewhat 
counter to conventional wisdom, as choke effects are commonly
cited as leading to economic hardship, it is a case-specific phenomenon caused 
by the current healthy state of the DER complex, and the protective nature 
of the choke effects as outlined above leading to lower realised harvest 
rates allowing the building of non-choke species biomass above $B_{MSY,SS}$. 
Such conditions lead to higher CPUE, which lowers fishing costs and increases
rent. However, like the multi-species harvest rates, rents under
$U_{MSY,SS}$ quickly fall after 
the initial windfall (Figure 9), with rents ultimately declining below
zero under both catch maximisation strategies. Rents under the $MSY_{MS}$ 
strategy declined more slowly in HSHG, given the choke effects and 
higher CPUE (Figure 9).

The Value-at-risk-5\% (i.e., $VAR-5\%$) gives the $5^{th}$ percentile
of the stochastic NPV distribution over all 100 replicates; in other words, 
the VAR-5\% gives an indication of the worst expected economic performance 
of a harvest strategy, occuring with a probability of 5\%. For $U_{MSY,MS}$ 
and $U_{MSY,MS}^*$, financial risk was quite high, with a VAR-5\% 
around \$570,000 (an average rent of \$28,000 $yr^{-1}$, when adjusted 
for the discount rate of 5\%) under $U_{MSY,MS}$, and \$140,000 (\$7,000
$yr^{-1}$) when targeting $U_{MSY,MS}^*$ (Table 7). It is likely that
neither $U_{MSY,SS}$ nor $U_{MSY,MS}$ harvest strategies represent a 
viable fishery in the long term, given that the rent calculations did not 
include several sources of fishing costs, and rents decline after an
initial short transient period (Figure 9). The $U_{MSY,SS}$ harvest 
rates had lower risk, with a $VAR-5\%$ of around \$3 million (\$150,000
$yr^{-1}$; Table 7).

Variability, and therefore risk, in NPV was reduced overall under $MEY$ 
based strategies. Both $U_{MEY}$ and $U_{MEY}^*$ have $VAR-5\%$ at 
around \$11 million (\$550,000 $yr^{-1}$; Table 7), which
is higher than 95\% of simulated NPVs under any $MSY$-based 
strategy. Further, the central 90\% of NPVs for the DER complex under 
both $MEY$-based harvest strategies ranged from around \$11 million at 
the low end to around \$13 million at the high end. In contrast, the 5th 
and 95th percentiles under $MSY$ harvest rates differed by over \$5 million, 
indicating much higher uncertainty in future economic yield when attempting to maximise 
catch. Variability in economic yield when maximising catch or rents is 
similar to that observed in the stochastic optimisation, where efforts 
optimised to maximise rent had a much tighter distribution than efforts 
optimised to maximise DER complex total yield over the 80 year
projection (Figure 5).


## Sensitivity to economic assumptions

As expected, reducing the dependence of unit price (demand) on catch or 
household income leads to higher NPVs for the DER complex (Table
8). Significantly higher NPVs under the two perfect own-price elasticity 
assumptions are based on no drop in price the at higher levels of catch 
(quantity supplied), which in turn encourage higher fishing effort 
(compare $E_{MEY}$ columns, Table 8 and 5). For the perfectly elastic and 
growing income scenario, NPV is even higher because the Rock sole
has positive income elasticity, leading to more fishing over time
in QCS (Appendix A). The NPV for the finite own-price elasticity and growing 
income scenario was the lowest among the three demand curve sensitivities 
(Table 8). Fixed incomes created a stable price/catch relationship that 
does not reduce prices over time, allowing fishing effort levels to remain
higher over the projections.

Time series of fishing effort for discount and income growth rate sensitivity 
scenarios sorted into two groups. The high discount rate ($d = 0.1$) and 
low income growth ($\gamma = 0.02$) scenarios had very similar optimal 
effort dynamics, and the low discount rate ($d = 0.025$) and high income 
growth ($\gamma = 0.058$) scenarios were also very similar (Figure 11). 
Similarities in the high-discount/low-growth scenarios continued across 
most of the projection period after an inital difference in all areas, 
where the higher discount rate initially attracted more fishing effort to 
take advantage of high initial CPUE (Figure 11). For the low discount/high
income growth scenarios, median optimal effort differed by area. Median 
efforts converged early in QCS and WCVI, and stayed close for 
the entire projection. In contrast, in the HSHG area, the two scenarios 
diverged in the middle of the projection period in the HSHG area, where the 
lower discount rate scenario applied higher fishing effort, while the high 
income growth scenario led to a quicker decline in effort. Dropping effort 
as income grows is expected, as a the unit price of all fish is dropping 
faster through negative income elasticity, and the species composition 
in HSHG is roughly equal among the DER complex. 
The Dover sole effect meant rent was less sensitive to increased effort, 
so combined with a lower discount rate (i.e., more value for future 
rents), efforts could remain higher.
