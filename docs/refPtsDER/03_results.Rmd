## Multi-species YPR reference points


### Multi-species maximum yield

Multi-species effort/yield relationships and the harvest rates that 
maximised multi-species complex yield followed a similar pattern in 
HSHG and QCS, but differed in WCVI (Figure 3, compare Tables 1 and 3). 
In HSHG and QCS areas, the optimal effort $E_{MSY,MS,p}$ produced lower 
optimal harvest rates for Dover sole and English sole (marginally) when 
compared to single species optimal harvest rates, while Rock sole
optimal harvest rates maximising multi-species yield were 20\% - 30\% 
higher than harvest rates maximising Rock sole yield alone (compare
$U_{MSY}$, Tables 1 and 3). In the WCVI area, $E_{MSY}$ led to a 5\%
higher English sole harvest rate when maximising DER complex yield than
English sole yield alone, while Dover sole harvest rates differed by 
less than a percentage point between the single-species and multi-species
optima, and Rock sole was slightly lower. Despite some large differences 
in optimal harvest rates, differences in $MSY_{SS}$ and $MSY_{MS}$ were subtle 
for all stocks, with a decrease of up to 5\% from $MSY_{SS}$ to $MSY_{MS}$ 
for any one stock. The total $MSY_{MS}$ for the DER complex fishery was
5.26 kt, which was only 110t, or 3%, lower than the sum of myopic (and
likely impossible to simultaneously achieve) $MSY_{SS}$ yields.

Annual resource rent at $MSY_{MS}$ assuming 2016 GDP per capita was around 
CAD \$1.72 million across the three stock areas. The area with the highest 
rent was HSHG at almost CAD \$1 million, attained at the lowest effort of the 
three areas (Table 3), which is as expected since the catchability and
total DER complex biomass is highest in HSHG. WCVI was next, which is
dominated by highly catchable Dover sole, that also had relatively 
inelastic demand (i.e., stable prices). Finally, QCS is the lowest rent
area given the higher costs of fishing, low catchability of all species,
and roughly equal mix of Rock and Dover soles.


### Multi-species maximum economic yield

Maximum economic yield (annual resource rent in 2016 dollars) for the 
DER complex trawl fishery was around CAD $2.02 million (Table 3). Fishing 
effort achieving $MEY$ was just above half of the effort level achieving
$MSY_{MS}$ for all areas. Similarly, the optimal harvest rates for $MEY$ 
were around 60\% of the harvest rates for $MSY_{MS}$. Despite the large 
drop in effort and harvest rates, catch differences were small given the 
higher equilibrium biomass at the lower fishing effort. The total difference 
in DER complex equilibrium catch between $MSY_{MS}$ and $C_{MEY}$ was 
approximately 420 t, with individual stock catches differing by an average 
of 9\%, with a minimum 0% difference for QCS Rock sole. 

Similar to above, resource rent was highest in the HSHG area at the lowest 
effort, reflecting the higher biomass of all species in that area 
(Table 4). While optimal effort $E_{MEY}$ in QCS was about 20\% higher 
than in WCVI, the resource rent was about 60\% higher in the WCVI area. 
As with the $MSY_{MS}$ case, higher WCVI rent is caused by the higher 
Dover sole biomass relative to English and Rock sols as well as higher 
commercial catchability and inelastic demand of Dover sole in the WCVI 
area, compensating for higher simulated fuel costs of fishing and 
increased rent in an area which was effectively a single-species fishery.


## Validation of reference points by effort optimisation

The most noticeable effect of the optimisation of projected
efforts was the change in demand. As time went on, GDP per capita
increased at a rate of 3.9% per year, lowering prices of English
and Rock soles [reference to appendix/figure]. Given the revenue reduction,
the stochastic optimisation of DER complex fishery NPV reduced efforts 
in all three areas, with the largest shift in HSHG, where English 
and Rock soles are most abundant, and the smallest change was in the 
WCVI area, where Dover sole, for which price does not depend on GDP per 
capita, dominated the total biomass by an order of magnitude. The 
reduction in effort when maximising NPV led to declining optimal 
fishing efforts for the majority of the projection period after
an initial development period to take advantage of the higher demand
in earlier years (Figure 5). Correspondingly, $U_{MEY}^*$ harvest rates
were consistently lower than the yield-per-recruit $U_{MEY}$ values by 
between 4 and 8 percentage points, or 20\% - 40\% of the YPR values 
(compare harvest rates, Tables 3 and 4). Despite the consistently
lower median harvest rates, distributions of NPV maximising harvest
rates contained the YPR $U_{MEY}$ value for both QCS and WCVI, where
Dover sole was at least 50\% of the catch (Figure 6). This also 
depressed the annual rents expected during the 2040 - 2060 period, 
dropping by between 42\% (WCVI) and 67\% (HSHG).

As expected, the price reduction had no significant effect on the 
approximations to $MSY_{MS}$ reference points, as resource rents 
were not included in the catch maximising objective function. Stochastic 
approximations of $E_{MSY,MS}^*$ were within 1 decimal place for the 
QCS and WCVI areas, and slightly higher for the HSHG area, which had a 
longer transitionary period before median dynamics settled at the YPR 
optima in each area (Figure 5). Similarly, distributions of harvest
rates were centred almost exactly at the YPR optimal $U_{MSY,MS}$ 
value (Figure 6), differing by around half of a percentage point on 
average, or around 0.5\% of the YPR optimum (compare Tables 3 and 4). 
Despite insensitivity of the biological reference points to the dropping
prices, the resource rents produced by the equilibria were significantly
reduced. In the HSHG area where the effect of per capita GDP was the 
highest, the annual rents dropped by CAD $1.3 million to become
negative, making fishing the DER complex unprofitable in that area. Rents 
remained positive in the QCS and WCVI areas, again because of lower 
abundance of English and Rock soles in those areas, but still dropped 
by 83\% (QCS) and 70\% (WCVI) when comparing median 2040 - 2060 values 
to the rent derived from the YPR analysis.


## Effort allocations

The optimal allocation of fishing effort among areas was independent of 
the total effort, and appeared largely determined by the distribution
of commercial catchability scalars within an area. For any fixed level 
of coast-wide effort $E$, the optimal allocation was always 
$\langle E_1, E_2, E_3 \rangle = \langle 0.25E, 0.42E, 0.33E \rangle$.
This allocation was very close to the ratio $\rho_p$ of inverse 
average commercial catchabilty scalars within an area to the sum
of inverse average catchabilities (Table 5 $1/\bar{q}^{(F)}$), defined by
\begin{align*}
\rho_p &= \frac{1/\bar{q}^{(F)}_p}{\sum_p 1/\bar{q}^{(F)}_p}, \\
\bar{q}^{(F)}_p & = \frac{1}{3} \sum_s q^{(F)}_{s,p}, \\
\end{align*}
indicating that the allocation is likely fixed based on $q^{F}_{s,p}$ 
values, and the price elasticity of demand $\lambda_s$ has a minor effect,
as the allocation was similar when $\lambda_s = \infty$ (Table S1).
The optimal allocation was also similar, but less so, to the relative 
allocation of effort $E_{MSY,MS,p}$ when maximising catch (Table 5).


## Applying optimal harvest rates in practice


### Conservation performance

Targeting either MSY or MEY through static or dynamic harvest rates 
did not pose any conservation risk under either perfect or imperfect 
biomass information (Figure 8). For $U_{MSY}$ and $U_{MSY}^*$ harvest
rates, biomasses in the projection period were above the equilibrium 
values given in Tables 4 and 6, as catch needed to develop from current
levels to the higher optimal harvest rates, requiring a development
period to the long-term equilibrium (e.g. Figure 9). In contrast, 
$B_{MEY}^*$ and $B_{MEY}^*$ was not always lower than the current biomass 
for all DER complex stocks, leading to more varied trajectories in the 
projection as choke dynamics had a larger effect (e.g., Figure 10); 
however, $B_{MEY}$ and $B_{MEY}^*$ values were always higher than
$B_{MSY}$ values, meaning that conservation risk was always lower 
under $U_{MEY}^*$ and $U_{MSY}^*$, despite lower biomass values under
the higher $U_{MEY}^*$ and $U_{MSY}^*$ harvest rates. Differences 
were largest between $U_{MEY}^*$ and $U_{MEY}$, with the 
static $B_{MEY}$ between 10\% and 20\% higher than the $B_{MEY}^*$. 
Given the relative values of $B_{MSY}$, $B_{MEY}$, and $B_{MSY,SS}$,
biological risk was acceptable for all harvest rates, with the 5th 
percentile of biomass was always above 40\% of the single-species 
$B_{MSY,SS}$, the level under which a stock is often considered 
critically overfished in Canada [@DFO2006A-Harvest-Strat].



### Economic performance

Relative health of the DER complex stocks provided conditions under which
catch maximisation gave an economic windfall. Median NPV of under MSY 
harvest rates was between $3M and $6M higher than the NPV under MEY 
harvest rates (Table 8), depending on the information scenario, or an
average of $190,000 - $375,000 in annual undiscounted rent. While 
higher NPV under catch maximisation is counter to conventional 
wisdom and our steady-state and dynamic optima (Tables 4, 6), they were 
present in the DER complex simulations because of the relative health
of DER complex stocks at the start of the projection. In 2016, all stocks 
were well above their respective $B_{MSY,SS}$, providing a standing biomass 
to fish down in all areas, creating higher catches at lower efforts (i.e.,
higher CPUE). During development, resource rents under both catch and
NPV maximising harvest rates were almost identical, and began to diverge
around 2021 in the QCS and WCVI, and 2024 in HSHS (Figure 11). After 
divergence, annual rents from catch maximising harvest rates continued to 
grow for 2 - 3 years while annual rents under the NPV maximising harvest 
rates leveled off for the remainder of the projection period, which is the
development windfall. After the peak, median annual rents under $U_{MSY}$ 
and $U_{MSY}^*$ declined below the $U_{MEY}$ and $U_{MEY}^*$ median rent, 
and around the same time the lower 5th percentile started to drift into 
negative rents (i.e. a net loss due to fishing), indicating that on a longer
time horizon than 32 years, the NPV under $U_{MSY}$ target harvest rates 
would shrink below the NPV under $U_{MEY}$ target harvest rates.

Despite higher median NPV under MSY harvest rates, there was significantly
greater risk at the tails. Under either $U_{MEY}$ or $U_{MEY}^*$ harvest
rates, the $VAR-5\%$ was about \$5M higher than for MSY under perfect
info ($310,000 annual rent on average) and about \$3M ($190,000 annually) 
higher under simulated assessment errors (Table 8), reflecting lower 
absolute biomass under MSY targets and higher costs of 
effort required to maintain maximum catch once development has occured and 
biomass has settled around the new equilibrium. Furthermore, targeting 
higher $U_{MEY}^*$ harvest rates appeared to have asymmetric risk, 
providing benefits with very little risk of loss. Median NPV under 
$U_{MEY}^*$ harvest rates were around \$3M higher ($190,000 per year) 
than under steady state $U_{MEY}$ harvest rates for both information 
scenarios, while $VAR-5\%$ was around \$16M for both $U_{MEY}^*$ and
$U_{MEY}$ under both information scenarios, indicating very little 
difference in downside between harvest. In contrast, the $VAR-95\%$ was 
about \$6M higher for the $U_{MEY}^*$ harvest rate under both scenarios, 
indicating that the higher harvest rate from the stochastic optimisation 
takes advantage of more favourable price and recruitment stochasticity, 
giving a more favourable upside.

    of using stochastic optimisation/omniscience/rational expectations
    to derive target HRs. How can we check? - wait for reruns with
    corrected price dist


Imperfect information appeared to insulate against economic loss
when setting TACs using $U_{MSY}$ and $U_{MSY}^*$. For both harvest
rates, median NPVs were between $400,000 and $640,000 higher when
TACs were set based on imperfect information, and the $VAR-5\%$ 
was around $2M higher ($125,000 per year). The difference
between information scenarios did not appear to affect the potential 
upside of maximising catch, with differences in the $VAR-95\%$ NPV 
between $140,000 and $210,000 over the projection period. 

Despite the insulating effect, imperfect information appeared to reduce 
rents under rent maximising harvest rates. Median NPVs and $VAR-95\%$ 
values were $1.7M - $2M ($100,000 - $125,000 per year) lower when TACs 
were set using imperfect information. Lower tails of NPVs under
$U_{MEY}$ and $U_{MEY}^*$ were less sensitive to the information 
level, with $VAR-5\%$ increasing by about $550,000 when setting 
TACs using perfect information under the steady state harvest rate, 
but decreasing by about $60,000 when using $U_{MEY}^*$. The opposite
effect of perfect information in $VAR-5\%$ values betwee $U_{MEY}$
and $U_{MEY}^*$ creates a downside of around \$590,000 to the more 
aggresive harvest rate, which translates to an average loss
of $40,000 annually, but does not represent realistic risk since 
perfect information is unachievable. 

As expected, there was very little difference between NPV distributions
when fishing using $U_{MSY}$ and $U_{MSY}^*$ (Table 8). Median and
$VAR-5\%$ NPVs were most different when setting TACs with perfect 
information, while $VAR-95\%$ was more different under the imperfect
information scenario. 




## Sensitivities

### Infinite PED

[**Sensitivity using inf PED**]
As expected, producers received a small transfer of rent from consumers
given the downward sloping demand curves with constant price elasticity 
of demand. At the estimated price elasticity of demand $\lambda_s$, maximum 
economic yield in each area was higher while optimal effort was lower, 
reflecting lower effort costs and higher revenues from artificial 
scarcity at lower quantity supplied. When $\lambda_s = \infty$, optimal 
effort was about 15\% higher in HSHG and QCS areas, and about 7\% higher 
in WCVI.
