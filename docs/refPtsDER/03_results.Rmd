## Stock assessment model fit

The stock assessment model was fit to the biomass indices and compositional
data outlined in the methods. Because the main application of the simulation
model was to generate realistic catches in the projections under each 
scenario/objective function, we focused the evaluation of model fit on 
biomass indices and commercial age data. 

The fits to biomass indices were overall satisfactory. Fits for all series
were almost unbiased, with mean residuals at most 0.07 in absolute value. 
Despite low bias, there were significant trends in residuals for the modern 
commercial CPUE index for all QCS stocks, and WCVI Rock sole, as well as for 
the Hecate Strait assemblage survey for all three species (Figure 4); poor 
fits to these indices was not completely unexpected, as the modern trawl CPUE 
was a fishery dependent commercial catch-rate series with underlying 
targeting behaviour, while the fishery independent Hecate Strait Assemblage 
survey had a fixed station design with very large survey blocks. There were 
no trends in the residuals for the historical CPUE series, but this is due 
to the time-varying catchability applied to that series. Finally, the 
Synoptic survey residuals were unbiased and did not exhibit any 
significant trends.

**Age fits**

Biomass time series and single-species biological reference point estimates 
indicate that all DER complex stocks were in a healthy state in 2016 (Table 3). 
Three out of nine stocks exhibited 1-way trip dynamics (HSHG and QCS Dover, 
and QCS Rock, Figure 5), where biomass only depleted over the period 1956 - 
2016, while the remaining stocks showed signs of growth, usually after the mid 
1990s, which could indicate that the growth was more related to the switch 
between historical and modern commerical CPUE indices. Indeed, the two smaller 
English sole stocks (QCS and WCVI) exhibit large jumps in biomass in 1996/1997,
right as the historical trawl CPUE ends and modern trawl CPUE begins, jumping 
almost all the way back to unfished levels in QCS. While these dynamics may 
indicate spurious recruitment dynamics for these two stocks in the mid 
1990s, the absolute size of the stocks is a very small proportion of the 
overall complex and so is is considered a minor issue for the results of 
this paper.

Commercial catchability scalars for the modern trawl fleet were estimated
as the mean log-residual between fishing mortality and trawl effort [eqref].
Estimates were similar among species in the HSHG (0.022 - 0.026) and 
QCS (0.014 - 0.016) areas, but more different in WCVI (0.012 - 0.025)
(Table X). Estimates of fishing mortality were distributed evenly around
the mean catchability relationship for the 1996 - 2016 period, with the
exception of some outliers in WCVI at around 22 thousand hours of trawling
in 1996, where Rock sole's observed relationship was almost twice the 
mean, and Dover and English were about half as catchable (Figure 6). These 
outliers may show a non-linear relationship between effort and mortality, 
counter to our assumption but also a realistic case, either from improved 
targeting  behaviour (increasing relationship, e.g., Rock sole), or 
over-depletion (decreasing relationship, e.g., Dover and English soles), 
but these data are not powerful enough to draw any such conclusions. Given
the closure of the BC trawl fishery in 1995 due to overfishing concerns
and poor reporting, it is likely that the outliers show overdepletion 
and/or poor record keeping at the beginning of the at-sea observer program.

## DER complex time-varying inverse demand curves

Fitting the time varying inverse demand curve model (Appendix B) to
ex-vessel unit price data showed that all three DER complex species
had relatively elastic demand (i.e., $\lambda_s > 1$ for all species
$s$; Figure 6, demand curves). Over time, reference prices steadily 
dropped from around $1 per kg in 2006 to lows around $0.50/kg - $0.75/kg
in 2011/2012 (Figure 6, Price time series), before increasing for 2-3 
years, with English sole reaching its maximum recorded ex-vessel and 
reference price estimate in 2013. In 2014, all three species reference 
prices dropped again and converged around $0.50/kg, before increasing 
again to the some of the highest observed prices in 2015 (Dover), 
or 2016 (English, Rock). As expected from the reference point and
biomass estimates (Table 3) observed ex-vessel prices are, with the
exception of Dover sole in 2006, above the reference price, indicating
that catches are generally below the coast-wide maximum sustainable
yield for each species. Observed prices for English and Rock sole were
generally much higher then reference prices, which is again expected
given the price elasticity of demand is much higher for Dover sole,
leading to a flatter demand curve (Figure 6).

TODO: SCALE deltas by their standard deviation (post-fit estimate)

The blocks of decreasing and increasing reference prices are reflected
in the random walk deviations (Figure 6, RW deviations). Early in the 
period $\delta_{s,t} < 0$ for all three species, becoming positive 
for 2010-2013, and so on. While random walks were closed to unbiased 
with mean deviations of at most 0.08 in absolute value, random walk 
jumps became more variable over time, with devaitions larger than 
1.0 only occuring in the last three years of the period. While the
blocking and shift in variation could signal model misspecification 
(e.g., some latent unmodeled process), they could also be caused by 
the small sample size.

## Steady-state reference points

### Multi-species maximum yield

Multi-species effort/yield relationships, and the harvest rates that 
maximised multi-species complex yield, followed a similar pattern in 
HSHG and QCS, but differed in WCVI (Figure 8, compare Tables 3 and 4). 
In HSHG and QCS areas, the optimal effort $E_{MSY,p}$ produced lower 
optimal harvest rates for Dover sole and English sole (marginally) when 
compared to single species optimal harvest rates, while Rock sole
optimal harvest rates maximising multi-species yield were 20\% - 30\% 
higher than harvest rates maxmising Rock sole yield alone (compare
$U_{MSY}$, Tables 3 and 4). In the WCVI area, $E_{MSY}$ led to a 5\%
higher English sole harvest rate when maximising DER complex yield than
English sole yield alone, while Dover sole harvest rates differed by 
less than a percentage point between the single-species and multi-species
optima, and Rock sole was slightly lower. Despite some large differences 
in optimal harvest rates, differences in MSY_SS and MSY_MS were subtle 
for all stocks, with a decrease of at most 5\% from MSY_SS to MSY_MS
to a total catch of XX.

Resource rent at MSY was around $620,000 CAD summed across the three
areas. The area with the highest resource rent was HSHG, attained at
the lowest effort of the three areas (Table 3). The QCS and WCVI
areas both had roughly equal equilibrium resource rents at MSY, with
QCS around 9% higher rent at 11% higher fishing effort.


### Multi-species maximum economic yield

Maximum economic yield (resource rent) for the DER complex trawl fishery 
was around $1.58m CAD (Table 4). Fishing effort achieving MEY was about 
one third of the effort level achieving MSY_MS for all areas. Similarly, 
the optimal harvest rates for MEY were around 40\% of the harvest rates 
for MSY_MS. Despite the large drop in effort and harvest rates, 
catches dropped by an average of [X\%], but as little as 9\% for HSHG
Rock sole, again given the higher equilibrium biomass at the lower
fishing effort. The total drop in DER complex equilibrium catch between 
MSY_MS and MEY was approximately 1.1 kt.

Once again, MEY was highest in the HSHG area at the lowest effort,
reflecting the higher biomass of all species in that area (Table 4). While
E_MEY in QCS was higher than in WCVI by a similar proportion to the
corresponding E_MSY values, the resource rent was about 40\% higher in 
the WCVI area. The higher WCVI rent is thanks largely to the higher 
Dover sole biomass in the WCVI, along with a higher price elasticity 
of demand for Dover sole, producing a higher landed value of Dover sole 
that compensated for the higher costs of fishing in the WCVI area.

At the assumed fuel costs, the resource rents of the DER complex fishery 
are dependent on technical interactions to remain positive. While it is 
profitable to fish each species individually at low effort levels, as 
effort increases at least one revenue curve drops below the marginal 
cost line before $E_{MEY}$ is reached (Figure 9). 

The optimal allocation of fishing effort among areas was independent of 
the total effort. For any fixed level of coast-wide effort $E$, the 
allocation was always 
$\langle E_1, E_2, E_3 \rangle = \langle p_1E, p_2E, p_3E \rangle$,
which we still need time to interpret... (pull ps from the table), check
if it matches Emsy/Emey proportions... Indicates that the allocation
is fixed based on the $\lambda_s$ and $q^{F}_{s,p}$ values, so perhaps 
the system is overdetermined? [No movement or ecological interactions,
which may break this]. This allocation was insensitive to random initial 
values for the optimisation.
