# Introduction

Most fisheries management policy frameworks continue to be single-species 
oriented, despite the overwhelming prevalence of both direct and indirect 
multi-species interactions in fisheries [@skern2016ecosystem; 
@marshall2019inclusion]. The direct effects of fishing occur via *technical 
interactions* among multiple fish species that are caught simultaneously
(e.g. bycatch or byproduct) and can lead to undesirable choke
effects [@pikitch1987use; @murawski1984mixed; @baudron2015adverse], 
while indirect effects occuring via *ecological interactions* involve 
increasing/decreasing predator or prey abundances caused by fishing
[@may1979management; @collie2001biological]. Both technical and ecological 
interactions affect fishery reference points derived from maximum 
sustainable yield (MSY) [@murawski1984mixed; @pikitch1987use; 
@collie2001biological; @may1979management] or maximum economic yield 
(MEY) [@hoshino2018estimating; @pascoe2020effectiveness; 
@guillen2013estimating], implying that fishery policies ignoring 
multi-species interactions are, by design, likely to produce sub-optimal 
outcomes in multi-species fisheries [@ono2017management]. 
Further, applying single-species MSY policies to large scale, multi-species 
ecosystems could cause severe deterioration in ecosystem 
structure and function [@walters2005possible]. 

Incorporating multi-species interactions into fishery reference
points and harvest strategies is a central component of ecosystem-based 
fisheries management (EBFM) and the ecosystem approach to fisheries 
management (EAFM) [@link2014integrating; @moffitt2016moving]. The EAFM 
paradigm extends single-species fisheries management by incorporating 
multi-species interactions and environmental drivers, but focuses on the 
management outcomes for a single managed stock or species; EBFM instead
considers a broader scope of management outcomes for the ecosystem as a 
whole [@link2014integrating]. Therefore, since EAFM is a subset of EBFM, 
for the remainder of this paper we will refer to both as EBFM. EBFM is a 
stated policy priority for several nations [ FAO and UN refs 
from @howell2021combining] and, as far back as the 1970s, the Canadian 
government prioritised EBFM for better triple-bottom line outcomes (i.e.,
conservation, economic, and social aspects) over single-species MSY based
management [@mercer1982multispecies; @benson2018options; 
@stephenson2017practical].

Spatial heterogeneity and price elasticity of demand are key processes 
within a multi-species context and may significantly affect MSY and 
MEY reference points. Variation 
in species densities among fishing areas may affect harvester location 
choices, which, in turn, may affect technical interactions [@smith2012new; 
@goethel2017accounting; @pascoe2018offsetting]. In several multi-species
MEY examples, spatial heterogeneity is implicitly included by using 
fleets-as-areas or metier definitions [@guillen2013estimating; 
@punt2020multispecies; @pascoe2020effectiveness]. Such implicit definitions
assume modeled populations are a single panmictic biomass 
[@berger2017space], averaging reference point estimates over the spatial 
variation that motivated the modeling choice. Further, the spatial
variation itself is ultimately indicative of either a connected 
meta-population, or a collection of independent sub-populations. Movement 
rates (or lack thereof) have a strong effect on the nature of the 
reference points [@goethel2016incorporating; @sanchirico2007sustainable]. 
As expected, independent sub-populations have independent MSY 
reference points, and independent MEY reference points will occur under 
the assumption of constant landed price, or infinitely elastic demand 
[@punt2020multispecies; @oken2020effects]. In reality, the price fetched
at market for a fish decreases with increasing catch via a downward 
sloping demand curve. The slope and shape of demand curves are related 
to the price elasticity of demand for the species being caught 
[@asche2007studies], and other factors including but not limited to 
household incomes, the price of substitutes (e.g., similar species), and 
the quantity supplied by competitors [@jaffry1999long; @cheng1988demand]. 
Given that several factors affecting price are exogenous to the fishery, and 
that at a small enough scale the location of capture is irrelevant to 
purchasers, demand effects occur at larger spatial scales than
the underlying population dynamics. Such spatial mismatches mean that 
demand for a species may be common to several sub-populations of that
species, depending on the market. Therefore, spatial heterogeneity in 
species densities produces area-specific effects on the price, and 
therefore the $MEY$, via the common market and its demand curve.


In this paper, we asked how spatial heterogeneity and price elasticity
of demand affected economic and conservation risks in a multi-species
fishery management context. We compared the management outcomes of harvest 
strategies targeting single- and multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference points
by evaluating them in the presence of realistic uncertainty about stock
status via closed loop simulation. We simulated a technically interacting
three species complex of right-eyed flounders (*Pleuronectidae Spp.*) - 
Dover sole (*Microstomus pacificus*), English sole (*Parophrys vetulus*), 
and (Southern) Rock sole (*Lepidopsetta bilineata*) - fished in three 
spatial strata by a common trawl fishery off the coast of British 
Columbia (BC), Canada. Commercial trawl catchability scalars were included 
to simulate technical interactions, which produced realistic choke effects 
where lower TACs for one or more species restricted total fishing effort in 
each area [@baudron2015adverse; @pascoe2015setting]. Technical interactions
were also included in multi-species MSY and MEY reference points 
calculations, with fishing revenues based on species demand curves assuming 
a constant price elasticity of demand [@jaffry1999long]. Single species MSY, 
multi-species MSY, and MEY reference points were estimated via 
yield-per-recruit analysis [@beverton1957dynamics; @murawski1984mixed; 
@pikitch1987use], and multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference points were 
validated via stochastic optimisation of simulated fishery effort over 
an 80-year projection with recruitment process error, where either the 
catch or net-present-value (NPV) of the fishery was maximized. We found
that when accounting for spatial heterogeneity and price elasticity of 
demand, $MEY$ harvest strategies consistently produced better 
conservation and economic performance than either single-species
or multi-species $MSY$ strategies, and single-species $MSY$ strategies
performed better than multi-species $MSY$ strategies. Our paper 
demonstrates a method for estimating and evaluating $MSY$ and $MEY$ 
reference points for mixed stock fisheries, and provides framework that 
can be readily extended for more complex questions, such as the effects 
of marine spatial planning on fishing effort dynamics.
