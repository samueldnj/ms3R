# Introduction

Most fisheries management policy frameworks continue to be single-species 
oriented, despite the overwhelming prevalence of both direct and indirect 
multi-species interactions in fisheries [@skern2016ecosystem; 
@marshall2019inclusion]. The direct effects of fishing occur via *technical 
interactions* among multiple fish species that are caught simultaneously
(e.g. bycatch) [@pikitch1987use; @murawski1984mixed], while indirect effects
occuring via *ecological interactions* involve increasing/decreasing
predator or prey abundances caused by fishing [@may1979management; 
@collie2001biological]. Both technical and ecological interactions affect 
fishery reference points derived maximum sustainable yield (MSY) 
[@murawski1984mixed; @pikitch1987use; @collie2001biological; 
@may1979management] or maximum economic yield (MEY) [@hoshino2018estimating;
@pascoe2020effectiveness] which implies that fishery policies ignoring
multi-species interactions are, by design, likely to produce sub-optimal
outcomes in multi-species fisheries [@ono2017management]. Further, 
applying single-species MSY policies to large scale, multi-species 
ecosystems could cause severe deterioration in ecosystem 
structure and function [@walters2005possible]. 

Incorporating multi-species interactions into fishery reference
points and harvest strategies is a central component of ecosystem-based 
fisheries management (EBFM) and the ecosystem approach to fisheries 
management (EAFM) [@link2014integrating; @moffitt2016moving]. EAFM 
extends single-species fisheries management by incorporating 
multi-species interactions and environmental drivers, but focuses on the 
management outcomes for a single managed stock or species; EBFM considers 
a broader scope of management outcomes for the ecosystem as a 
whole [@link2014integrating]. Therefore, for the remainder of this
paper, we will use EBFM to refer to both. EBFM is a stated policy priority 
for several nations [ FAO and UN refs 
from @howell2021combining] and, as far back as the 1970s, the Canadian 
government prioritised EBFM for better triple-bottom line outcomes (i.e.,
conservation, economic and social aspects) over single-species MSY based
management [@mercer1982multispecies; @benson2018options; 
@stephenson2017practical].

Spatial heterogeneity and price elasticity of demand, which are often 
ignored, may significantly affect MSY and MEY reference points. Variation 
in species densities among fishing areas may affect harvester location 
choices, which, in turn, may affect technical interactions [@smith2012new; 
@goethel2017accounting; @pascoe2018offsetting]. In several multi-species
MEY examples, spatial heterogeneity is implicitly included by using 
fleets-as-areas or metier definitions [@guillen2013estimating; 
@punt2020multispecies; @pascoe2020effectiveness]. Such implicit definitions
assume modeled populations are a single panmictic biomass 
[@berger2017space], averaging reference point estimates over the spatial 
variation that motivated the modeling choice. Further, the spatial
variation itself is ultimately indicative of either a connected 
meta-population, or a collection of independent sub-populations. Movement 
rates (or lack thereof) have a strong effect on the nature of the 
reference points [@goethel2016incorporating; @sanchirico2007sustainable]. 
As expected, independent sub-populations have independent MSY 
reference points, and independent MEY reference points will occur under 
the assumption of constant landed price, or infinitely elastic demand 
[@punt2020multispecies; @oken2020effects]. In reality, the price fetched
at market for a fish decreases with increasing catch via a downward 
sloping demand curve. The slope and shape of demand curves are related 
to the price elasticity of demand for the species being caught 
[@asche2007studies], and other factors including but not limited to 
household incomes, the price of substitutes (e.g., similar species), and 
the quantity supplied by competitors [@jaffry1999long; @cheng1988demand]. 
Given that several factors affecting price are exogenous to the fishery, and 
that at a small enough scale the location of capture is irrelevant to 
purchasers, demand effects occur at larger spatial scales than
the underlying population dynamics. Such spatial mismatches mean that 
demand for a species may be common to several sub-populations of that
species, depending on the market. Therefore, spatial heterogeneity in 
species densities produces a unique catch composition produced by
a unit of effort in a given area. Spatial variation in catch compositions 
then implies area-specific effects on the price, and MEY, via the common 
market and its demand curve.


In this paper, we found that when accounting for spatial heterogeneity
and price elasticity of demand, MEY and multi-species MSY harvest strategies 
consistently produced better conservation and economic performance than 
myopic single-species MSY strategies. To compare the three harvest 
strategies, we simulated a three species complex of right-eyed flounders 
(*Pleuronectidae Spp.*) - Dover sole (*Microstomus pacificus*), English sole 
(*Parophrys vetulus*), and (Southern) Rock sole (*Lepidopsetta bilineata*) - 
fished in three spatial strata by a common trawl fishery off the coast of 
British Columbia (BC), Canada. Species demand curves with a constant price 
elasticity of demand were estimated via a 2-stage least-squares regression 
[IV method ref],
and then combined with area-specific costs of fishing to define a production
function that depended on the spatial allocation of fishing effort. Single
species MSY, multi-species MSY, and MEY reference points were estimated
via yield-per-recruit analysis [holtref; @murawski1984mixed; @pikitch1987use], 
and multi-species MSY and MEY reference points were validated via
stochastic optimisation of simulated fishery effort over an 80-year time
horizon with recruitment process error, where the either catch or 
net-present-value (NPV) of the fishery was maximised. Finally, we tested 
harvest strategies targeting single- and multi-species MSY and MEY 
reference points in closed loop simulation to estimate economic and 
conservation risks of each when used to set catch limits in the presence 
of realistic stock status uncertainty.
