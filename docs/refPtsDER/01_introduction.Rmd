# Introduction

Most fisheries management policy frameworks continue to be single-species 
oriented, despite the overwhelming prevalence of both direct and indirect 
multi-species interactions in fisheries [@skern2016ecosystem; 
@marshall2019inclusion]. The direct effects of fishing occur via *technical 
interactions* among multiple fish species that are caught simultaneously
(e.g. bycatch or byproduct) [@pikitch1987use; @murawski1984mixed; 
@baudron2015adverse], while indirect effects occuring via *ecological 
interactions* in response to increasing/decreasing predator or 
prey abundances caused by fishing [@may1979management; 
@collie2001biological]. Both technical and ecological interactions 
affect fishery reference points (i.e., management targets) derived from 
maximum sustainable yield (MSY) [@murawski1984mixed; @pikitch1987use; 
@collie2001biological; @may1979management] or maximum economic yield 
(MEY) [@hoshino2018estimating; @pascoe2020effectiveness; 
@guillen2013estimating], implying that fishery policies ignoring technical 
and ecological interactions are, by design, likely to produce sub-optimal 
outcomes in multi-species fisheries [@ono2017management]. 

Incorporating multi-species interactions into fishery reference
points and harvest strategies is a central component of ecosystem-based 
fisheries management (EBFM) and the ecosystem approach to fisheries 
management (EAFM) [@link2014integrating; @moffitt2016moving]. The EAFM 
paradigm extends single-species fisheries management by incorporating 
multi-species interactions and environmental drivers, but focuses on the 
management outcomes for a single managed stock or species, while EBFM 
considers a broader scope of management outcomes for the ecosystem as a 
whole [@link2014integrating]. Therefore, since EAFM is a subset of EBFM, 
for the remainder of this paper we will refer to both as EBFM. Several
fishing nations include EBFM as a policy priority [@FAO1995; @fao2008fisheries;
@un-fsa1995agreement-for-t] and, as far back as the 1970s, the Canadian 
government prioritised EBFM for better triple-bottom line outcomes (i.e.,
conservation, economic, and social aspects) over single-species MSY based
management [@mercer1982multispecies; @benson2018options; 
@stephenson2017practical].

MSY reference points are common targets in fishery management policies, 
but MEY reference points are not. MSY reference points are
targeted when fishery policy is to maximise equilibrium biological yield 
(i.e., catch) from a stock. Given the risks associated with targeting a
fixed catch at $MSY$ [@larkin1977epitaph; @smith1993risk], $MSY$ is now 
often considered a limit to the total catch [@mace2001new], and many fishery
policies target $U_{MSY}$ harvest rates that produce $MSY$ on average. 
However, while fishery policies targeting $U_{MSY}$ can have acceptable 
conservation risk for an individual stock [ref], socio-economic and 
ecosystem outcomes are often not considered under MSY based policies. 
Further, there is evidence that repeated application of single-species 
MSY policies will degrade eco-system function in a multi-species context 
[@walters2005possible]. In some jurisdictions (e.g., Australia), fishery 
management policies target MEY reference points, which seek to maximise 
resource rent from the fishery by increasing catch rates through higher 
biomass and lower harvest rates [@hoshino2018estimating]. Increased rents 
produce improved socio-economic outcomes, and there are implicit 
conservation benefits associated with higher biomass levels. Despite the 
advantages, fishery policies targeting MEY are uncommon, perhaps due to 
the extra layer of economic modeling required with the uncertainty in
economic assumptions and parameters [ref]. 

Fishery reference points also depend on spatial heterogeneity, or patchiness, 
of the stock, where biomass density varies over space. If spatial heterogeneity 
is ignored by harvest policies and catch limits, management actions will 
produce sub-optimal triple-bottom-line performance [@goethel2017accounting]. 
For a single-species, multi-area fishery, fishing effort is attracted to 
higher density patches to take advantage of higher catch rates, lowering the
costs of fishing. When spatial variation is ignored in fishery models, fish and 
fishing effort are assumed to be uniformly distributed across space and reference 
point estimates represent spatial averages [@berger2017space]. Fishery policy 
based on spatial averages tends to over- and under-fish in all patches, 
because catch limits are mismatched to the spatial variation in fishing 
effort and fish density/productivity. The mismatch can worsen for 
multi-species fisheries, where the distribution of biomass density differs 
for each species. That variation produces different relative catch rates 
among species and areas, creating more complexity in the distribution of fishing 
effort than the single-species case, as harvesters target specific species.

Even when reference points are based on the appropriate spatial scale, there 
are still complications caused by technical interactions in multi-species
fisheries. Each species has its own level of availability to the fishing gear
(catchability), meaning that the fishing pressure felt by each species differs 
under a unit of fishing effort. Furthermore, the applied fishing pressure is 
often not scaled to individual species productivities, unless the fishery is
strictly effort controlled. Such differences can create choke effects 
[@baudron2015adverse], where catch limits for one "choke" species are filled 
faster than the others, potentially limiting access to higher value species. 
Such choke effects may be avoided (on average) by scaling catch limits to the 
technical interactions among species [@murawski1984mixed; @pikitch1987use; 
@hoshino2018estimating; @guillen2013estimating; @johnson2021hierarchical], 
which is a requirement for MEY calculations when catches are mixed,
given the difficulty teasing apart the costs of fishing.

The link between spatial heterogeneity, market demand, and MEY reference
points is unclear for multi-species fisheries, and often ignored in 
fisheries economics literature. A common simplifying assumption is that the 
unit price of a fish is not affected by the quantity landed. Under a constant 
price assumption, if sub-populations are independent, then the MEY reference 
point estimates are also independent [@sanchirico2007sustainable]. In reality, 
the market price for a fish decreases with increasing catch via a downward 
sloping demand curve [@pascoe2018offsetting]. The slope and shape of demand 
curves are related to the own-price elasticity of demand for the species being 
caught [@asche2007studies], which represents the change in quantity demanded 
for a unit change in price. Other factors that affect demand include household 
incomes, the price of substitutes (e.g., similar species or other proteins), 
and the quantity supplied by competitors [@jaffry1999long; @cheng1988demand]. 
Thus, demand curves act at a broader spatial scale than the spatial patches
of a population, so catches from each patch will affect the price differently,
implying a different optimal harvest rates than the constant price assumption,
which is often excluded from bio-economic analyses. 

In this paper, we investigated how spatial heterogeneity and price 
elasticity of demand affected economic and conservation risks in a 
multi-species fishery management context. We simulated management outcomes of 
harvest policies based on both single- and multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ 
reference points. A technically interacting three species complex of 
right-eyed flounders (*Pleuronectidae Spp.*) - Dover sole (*Microstomus 
pacificus*), English sole (*Parophrys vetulus*), and (Southern) Rock sole 
(*Lepidopsetta bilineata*) - was simulated in three spatial strata, fished 
by a common trawl fishery off the coast of British Columbia (BC), Canada. 
Commercial trawl catchability scalars simulated technical interactions, 
producing realistic choke effects restricting total fishing effort in 
each area [@baudron2015adverse; @pascoe2015setting]. The same technical 
interactions were included in multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference points 
calculations, with fishing revenues based on species demand curves assuming 
a constant price elasticity of demand [@jaffry1999long]. Single species 
$MSY$, multi-species $MSY$, and $MEY$ reference points were estimated via 
yield-per-recruit analysis [@beverton1957dynamics; @murawski1984mixed; 
@pikitch1987use], and multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference points were 
validated via stochastic optimisation of simulated fishery effort over 
an 80-year projection with recruitment process error, where either the 
catch or net-present-value (NPV) of the fishery was maximized. We showed
that, after accounting for spatial heterogeneity and price elasticity of 
demand - two realistic features of actual fisheries - $MEY$ harvest 
policies consistently produced better conservation and economic outcomes 
than either single-species or multi-species $MSY$ policies. It is
therefore surprising that $MEY$-based strategies are so uncommong in
contemporary fisheries management, especially given their prominence
in ecosystem-based fisheries policy.
