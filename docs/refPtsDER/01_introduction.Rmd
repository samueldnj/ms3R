# Introduction

Most fisheries management policy frameworks continue to be single-species 
oriented, despite the overwhelming prevalence of *technical interactions*
in which multiple fish species are caught in non-selective fishing gear 
[@skern2016ecosystem; @marshall2019inclusion;@pikitch1987use; 
@murawski1984mixed; @baudron2015adverse]. In multi-species fisheries,
technical interactions affect fishery reference points and management 
targets derived from both maximum sustainable yield ($MSY$) and maximum 
economic yield ($MEY$) paradigms [@may1979management; @murawski1984mixed; 
@pikitch1987use; @collie2001biological;@hoshino2018estimating; 
@pascoe2020effectiveness; @guillen2013estimating]. Thus, policies ignoring 
technical interactions are, by design, likely to produce sub-optimal 
outcomes in multi-species fisheries [@ono2017management]. 

Reference points based on $MSY$ aim to maximize equilibrium biological
yield from a fish stock [@mace2001new], while $MEY$ reference points seek 
to maximize resource rent from a fishery 
[@dichmont2010implementing; @hoshino2018estimating]. The main difference 
between $MSY$ and $MEY$ is that the latter aims for higher catch per unit
of effort (catch rates) via higher target biomass and lower harvest rates 
on the most valuable species/stocks [@hoshino2018estimating]. From a 
single-species perspective, greater resource rents obtained under an $MEY$ 
paradigm increase economic welfare and improve conservation outcomes 
through higher standing stock biomass. However, despite these advantages, 
fishery policies targeting $MEY$ are uncommon, perhaps because most 
fisheries involve multiple species where $MEY$ would imply difficult 
trade-offs among multiple species and multiple stocks 
[@dichmont2010implementing]. Specifically, trade-offs that likely 
require that some (e.g., low value) species/stocks remain chronically 
overfished for the benefit of the overall multi-species fishery 
[@dichmont2010implementing]. 
The challenge for multi-species fisheries managers, then, is finding 
approaches to assessing and managing these trade-offs without causing 
unacceptable conservation risks to any individual species and/or stocks.

In general, $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference points estimate fishery equilibrium 
states assuming a single, homogeneous unit-stock [@cadrin2013stock]. 
In reality, most fish populations are, to varying degrees, a collection 
of semi-isolated sub-stocks with unique productivities, biomass densities, 
and carrying-capacities. Ignoring such *spatial heterogeneity* 
in productivity and biomass density when estimating reference points
will produce spatially averaged equilibria. Harvest strategies based on such 
spatially averaged reference points tend to over-harvest roughly half of 
all sub-stocks, and under-harvest the rest [@berger2017space; 
@goethel2017accounting]. 

In spatially heterogeneous fisheries, fishing activity is presumably 
attracted to higher density patches to take advantage of higher catch 
rates and reduced search costs [@gillis1993movement]. If catch limits 
are based on spatially averaged reference points but fishing is 
concentrated on one particalar sub-stock, then that sub-stock will tend 
to be over-harvested relative to its stock-specific reference points. This 
mismatch between the scale of population dynamics (i.e., spatial 
heterogeneity) and the scale of control given by the harvest strategy 
is further complicated in multi-species fisheries, where local-scale 
productivities and densities differ among species occupying the same area.

Even where biological reference points such as $MSY$ or $MEY$ are matched 
to the spatial scale of population dynamics, technical interactions further 
complicate the implementation of those reference points within harvest 
strategies. Within multi-species fisheries, each species has somewhat
unique availability to fishing gear (catchability), meaning that fishing 
pressure felt by each species differs for a given amount of fishing 
activity. Furthermore, unless the fishing activity (effort) is strictly 
controlled in space or time, the applied fishing pressure is rarely scaled 
to individual species productivities. Often, multi-species 
spatial heterogeneity attracts (or repels) fishing activity in ways
that are unrelated to each individual stock's reference points. For example,
harvesters may be drawn to a fishing ground to target one species, or to 
avoid another species, while at the same time attempting to maximise catch 
rates and lower fishing costs [@gillis1993movement].

The trade-offs associated with ignoring technical interactions 
are unclear for spatially heterogeneous, multi-species fisheries. The 
attractiveness of each area to harvesters is intrinsically linked
to the mix of species in each area, via the expected resource
rent from that mix. Resource rent from a fishery captures the 
difference between the costs and revenues of fishing 
[@hoshino2018estimating]. Some fishing costs are variable, such as fuel 
and crew share, while other costs, such as on capital and/or debt service, 
are fixed. Revenues depend primarily on the relationship between the size 
of the landed catch (quantity supplied) and the unit price, as captured
by the demand curve. Quantity demanded in the market is determined
by consumer preferences and societal factors such as household income, 
the price of substitutes (e.g., similar species or other proteins), and 
the quantity supplied by competitors, which are captured in demand
curves through price elasticities [@jaffry1999long; @cheng1988demand;
@asche2007studies]. Thus, demand dynamics often operate at broader spatial 
scales than the spatial heterogeneity of a fish stock, so that catches from 
each stock will affect the price differently, implying different optimal 
harvest rates for each stock. Therefore, while conservative harvest strategies 
that ignore technical interactions may produce acceptable conservation 
performance, they are likely to create sub-optimal distributions of 
fishing effort with lower resource rents.

In this paper, we investigate conservation and economic trade-offs arising
when multi-species vs single-species harvest strategies are applied to a 
spatially heterogeneous, multi-species fishery. Harvest strategies are 
defined based on both single- and multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference 
points applied to a complex of three right-eyed flounders 
(*Pleuronectidae Spp.*) comrising Dover sole (*Microstomus pacificus*), 
English sole (*Parophrys vetulus*), and (Southern) Rock sole (*Lepidopsetta 
bilineata*). This three species complex is simulated in three spatially 
heterogeneous areas, where they are fished by a common trawl fishery off 
the coast of British Columbia (BC), Canada. Simulated fishing effort in 
each area has realistic constraints caused by technical interactions among the 
three species [@baudron2015adverse; @pascoe2015setting]. Those same technical 
interactions are incorporated into multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ 
reference points, which, along with single species $MSY$ reference points,
are estimated analytically via a yield-per-recruit analysis 
[@beverton1957dynamics; @murawski1984mixed; @pikitch1987use; 
@hoshino2018estimating]. Multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference points are
compared to long-run average simulated efforts derived from an 80-year 
projection with recruitment process variability, where either the catch or 
net-present-value (NPV) of the fishery was maximised. We show that, after 
accounting for own-price elasticity of demand and spatial heterogeneity
in population dynamics - two realistic features of actual fisheries - $MEY$ 
harvest strategies consistently produce better conservation and economic 
outcomes than either single-species or multi-species $MSY$ policies. 
While $MEY$ harvest stratgies have their shortcomings 
[@dichmont2010implementing], it is surprising that $MEY$-based strategies 
are not more common in contemporary fisheries management, especially 
given their prominence in ecosystem based fisheries policy 
[@mercer1982multispecies].
