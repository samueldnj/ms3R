# Introduction

Most fisheries management policy frameworks continue to be single-species 
oriented, despite the overwhelming prevalence of *technical interactions*
in which multiple fish species are caught in non-selective fishing gear 
[@skern2016ecosystem; @marshall2019inclusion;@pikitch1987use; 
@murawski1984mixed; @baudron2015adverse]. In multi-species fisheries,
technical interactions affect fishery reference points and management 
targets derived from both maximum sustainable yield ($MSY$) and maximum 
economic yield ($MEY$) paradigms [@may1979management; @murawski1984mixed; 
@pikitch1987use; @collie2001biological;@hoshino2018estimating; 
@pascoe2020effectiveness; @guillen2013estimating]. Thus, policies ignoring 
technical interactions are, by design, likely to produce sub-optimal 
outcomes in multi-species fisheries [@ono2017management]. 

Reference points based on $MSY$ aim to maximize equilibrium biological
yield from a fish stock [@mace2001new], while $MEY$ reference points seek 
to maximize resource rent (i.e., profit) from a fishery 
[@dichmont2010implementing; @hoshino2018estimating]. The main difference 
between $MSY$ and $MEY$ is that the latter aims for higher catch rates via 
higher target biomass and lower harvest rates on the most valuable 
species/stocks [@hoshino2018estimating]. From a single-species perspective, 
greater resource rents obtained under an $MEY$ paradigm can have societal
benefits through increased welfare for harvesters and improved conservation 
outcomes through higher standing stock biomass. However, despite these 
advantages, fishery policies targeting $MEY$ are uncommon, perhaps because 
most fisheries involve multiple species where $MEY$ would imply difficult 
trade-off choices among multiple species spread over multiple stocks 
[@dichmont2010implementing]. Specifically, trade-off choices that likely 
require that some (e.g., low value) species/stocks remain chronically 
overfished to some degree for the benefit of the overall multi-species 
fishery [@dichmont2010implementing]. 
The challenge for multi-species fisheries managers, then, is finding 
approaches to assessing and managing along these trade-offs without causing 
unacceptable conservation risks to any individual species and/or stocks.

In general, $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference points estimate fishery equilibrium 
states assuming a single, homogeneous unit-stock. In reality, most fish 
populations are, to varying degrees, a collection of semi-isolated 
sub-stocks with unique productivities, biomass densities, and 
carrying-capacities. Ignoring such *spatial heterogeneity* 
in productivity and biomass density when estimating reference points
will produce spatially averaged equilibria. Harvest strategies based on such 
spatially averaged reference points tend to over-harvest roughly half of 
all sub-stocks, and under-harvest the rest [@berger2017space; 
@goethel2017accounting]. 

In spatially heterogeneous fisheries, fishing activity is presumably 
attracted to higher density patches to take advantage of higher catch 
rates and reduced fishing costs [@gillis1993movement]. If catch limits 
are set based on spatially averaged reference points while fishing is 
concentrated on a particalar sub-stock, then that sub-stock will tend to be 
over-harvested relative to its stock-specific reference points. This 
mismatch between the scale of population dynamics (i.e., spatial 
heterogeneity) and the scale of control given by the harvest strategy 
is further complicated in multi-species fisheries, where local-scale 
productivities and densities differ among species occupying the same area.

Even where biological reference points such as $MSY$ or $MEY$ are matched 
to the spatial scale of population dynamics, technical interactions further 
complicate the implementation of those reference points within harvest 
strategies. Within multi-species fisheries, each species has somewhat
unique availability to fishing gear (catchability), meaning that fishing 
pressure felt by each species differs for a given amount of fishing 
activity. Furthermore, unless the fishing activity (effort) is strictly 
controlled in space or time, the applied fishing pressure is rarely scaled 
to individual species productivities. Often, multi-species 
spatial heterogeneity attracts (or repels) fishing activity in ways
that are unrelated to each individual stock's reference points. For example,
harvesters may be drawn to a fishing ground to target one species, or to 
avoid another species, while at the same time attempting to maximise catch 
rates and lower fishing costs [@gillis1993movement].

The trade-offs associated with ignoring technical interactions 
are unclear for spatially heterogeneous, multi-species fisheries. The 
attractiveness of each area to harvesters is intrinsically linked
to the mix of species in each area, via the expected resource
rent from that mix. Resource rent from a fishery captures the 
difference between the costs and revenues of fishing 
[@hoshino2018estimating]. Some fishing costs are variable, such as fuel, 
crew share, quota leasing, and marketing, while other costs, such as 
on capital and/or debt service, are fixed. Revenues are also variable, 
depending primarily on the relationship between the size of the landed 
catch (quantity) and the unit price. The unit price depends on the demand 
for fishery products within the market being supplied by harvesters. Market 
demand is affected by the quantity of the product (and alternatives) being 
supplied, through price elasticity of demand [@asche2007studies;
@jaffry1999long], as well as societal factors such as household income, 
the price of substitutes (e.g., similar species or other proteins), and 
the quantity supplied by competitors [@jaffry1999long; @cheng1988demand]. 
Thus, demand dynamics often operate at broader spatial scales than the 
spatial heterogeneity of a fish stock, so that catches from each stock 
will affect the price differently, implying different optimal harvest 
rates for each stock. Therefore, while conservative harvest strategies 
that ignore technical interactions may acceptable conservation performance, 
they are likely to create sub-optimal distributions of fishing effort
with lower resource rents.

In this paper, we investigate conservation and economic trade-offs arising
when multi-species vs single-species harvest strategies are applied to a 
spatially heterogeneous, multi-species fishery. Harvest strategies are 
defined based on both single- and multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference 
points applied to a simulated complex of right-eyed flounders 
(*Pleuronectidae Spp.*) comrising Dover sole (*Microstomus pacificus*), 
English sole (*Parophrys vetulus*), and (Southern) Rock sole (*Lepidopsetta 
bilineata*). This three species complex is simulated in three spatially 
heterogeneous areas, fished by a common trawl fishery off the coast of 
British Columbia (BC), Canada. Simulated fishing effort in each area has 
realistic constraints caused by technical interactions among the three 
species [@baudron2015adverse; @pascoe2015setting]. Those same technical 
interactions are incorporated into multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ 
reference points [@murawski1984mixed;@pikitch1987use;@hoshino2018estimating]. 
Single species $MSY$, multi-species $MSY$, and $MEY$ reference points 
are estimated analytically via a yield-per-recruit analysis 
[@beverton1957dynamics; @murawski1984mixed; @pikitch1987use], and 
multi-species $MSY$ and $MEY$ reference points are compared to long-run 
average simulated efforts optimised over an 80-year projection with 
recruitment process variability, where either the catch or 
net-present-value (NPV) of the fishery was maximised. We show that, after 
accounting for spatial heterogeneity in population dynamics and price 
elasticity of demand - two realistic features of actual fisheries - $MEY$ 
harvest strategies consistently produce better conservation and economic 
outcomes than either single-species or multi-species $MSY$ policies. 
While $MEY$ harvest stratgies have their shortcomings 
[@dichmont2010implementing], it is surprising that $MEY$-based strategies 
are not more common in contemporary fisheries management, especially 
given their prominence in ecosystem based fisheries policy 
[@mercer1982multispecies].
