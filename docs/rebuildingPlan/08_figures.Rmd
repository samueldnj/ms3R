mseFigCap <- "Schematic of the closed loop simulation approach taken here comprises operating model (OM) scenarios that represent alternative hypotheses of OYE biology, ecology, exploitation history and environmental conditions (Env) that are fit to historic data (dotted box). The operating model scenarios are used to simulate future estimates of the data which are fit after applying a Harvest Control Rule (HCR) to set the catch under each management procedure at each annual time step. The simulation repeats until the end of the projection period. The assessment model is run at each time step to evaluate management performance against the objectives (adapted from @cox2010a)."
