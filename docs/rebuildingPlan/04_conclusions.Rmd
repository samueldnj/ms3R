# Conclusions

While the most and least optimistic operating models effectively show 
the range of outcomes that are possible for the HG herring fishery, 
we caution against using extreme cases for making management decisions 
as they may create a misleading picture of expected fishery 
performance. Extreme cases are rarely highly plausible, as they often 
represent states of nature (or combinations thereof) that have low 
probability of occuring.
