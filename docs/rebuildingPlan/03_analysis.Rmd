## Evaluation of potential rebuilding strategies using closed loop simulation

Fishery models play important roles in the design and operation of feedback 
fishery management systems. Fishery operating models use data obtained from 
scientific monitoring to estimate historical abundances and productivity 
under alternative hypotheses for, *inter alia*, environmental conditions and 
fish stock biology. Alternative hypotheses are used to condition operating
model scenarios that drive closed loop simulations of fishery management
systems, which evaluate alternative management procedures in computer experiments
(Figure \@ref(fig:msefig)). These so called Management Strategy Evaluations 
(MSEs) speed up learning about the fisheries management system while avoiding 
putting fish stocks and fisheries at risk in real experiments. In a closed-loop
simulation experiment, annual inferences of stock status based on simulated data 
flow through a decision rule, which sets the next year's fishery removals. In the 
following year, removals are taken from the stock via simulated fishing mortality, 
and new data is generated for application of the procedure again, repeating in this
way until the pre-determined end of the computer experiment. In this way, the
expected performance of a simulated fishery management procedure can be estimated
via pre-determined performance metrics, indicating acceptable procedures with
respect to fishery objectives, and their relative rank. Simulated procedure
performance is ideally integrated over several operating model scenarios representing
major uncertainties that are difficult to resolve. For example, environment-stock 
interactions such as recruitment and predation mortality are among the most 
uncertain aspects of fishery management systems because the dynamics are non-linear 
and only partially observable. Therefore, multiple alternative hypotheses on 
recruitment and predation (natural) mortality may be used to condition 
operating model scenarios to ensure management procedures are robust to those
uncertainties, as the plausibility of those hypotheses may not be known until 
long after a procedure is chosen. In this paper, we used closed-loop simulation to 
evaluate the expected ability of four proposed rebuilding procedures (RPs) to 
meet rebuilding objectives for Pacific Herring in Haida Gwaii following a 
step-wise approach[@cox2010a]:

1. Define a range of alternative management procedures (RPs) 
defined by (i) **data** types and precision, (ii) **assessment 
methods** for establishing stock status, (iii) **harvest control 
rules (HCRs)** for setting annual catch limits; and (iv) **meta-rules** 
for modifying annual catch limits given pre-defined constraints and 
conditions as required. Meta-rules might involve time intervals, 
constraints on fisheries, spatial and fishery allocation rules, and/or 
rules for revising the RPs, as well as “exceptional circumstances” 
that provide trigger points and subsequent actions when RPs are 
considered unreliable.

2. Specify an operating model (OM) to enable simulation of alternative 
plausible scenarios for Haida Gwaii Herring population responses to 
fishing and data generation mechanisms. This step involves first 
fitting the operating model to available data to estimate model 
parameters consistent with the stock history and structural assumptions 
of OM scenarios.

3. Project Haida Gwaii Herring stock dynamics and fishery harvesting 
forward from its current state for each management procedure under each 
alternative OM scenario. Each year and simulation replicate of the 
projection involves the following steps:
	i) Simulate the **data** available for stock assessment and append to 
  existing data sets;
	ii) Apply the **assessment method** to the data to estimate quantities 
  required by the **harvest control rule**;
	iii) Apply the **harvest control rule** to generate a catch limit;
	iv) Apply **meta-rules** such as area and fishery allocation rules;
	v) Subtract the final catch limit from the simulated Herring population 
  as represented by the operating model;
	vi) Return to Step 3a until final projection year
	vii) Repeat Step 3a-f for 100 independent replicate simulations

4. Calculate a set of quantitative performance measures based on the 
100 simulation replicates that can be used to compare and rank RP 
performance against the conservation and fishery objectives.


## Operating model

The Spatially Integrated Statistical Catch-at-Age Herring (SISCAH) 
Operating Model (OM) is an age-structured model with multiple biologically
independent sub-areas (i.e., there is no biomass or recruitment exchange
among areas in this version of the model). The Haida Gwaii herring stock is 
currently managed across 5 sections that are grouped into the three sub-areas 
(from north to south) - Cumshewa/Selwyn (*C/S*, 023/024), 
Juan-Perez/Skincuttle (*JP/S*, 021/025), and Louscoone (*Lou*, 006) - for 
operating model fitting (Figure 1). Available data at this spatial scale
include: (i) fleet-specific landed catch and age-composition data (1951 - 
2019) from the commercial reduction, seine-roe, and gillnet fisheries; 
(ii) closed-pond spawn-on-kelp (SOK) landings; and (iii) fishery independent 
spawn indices from the surface survey (1951 - 1987) and dive survey 
(1988 - 2019). **Model notation and equations are given in Tables 1 and 2, 
respectively. <- STILL INCLUDE THESE??**

SISCAH includes both closed-pond and open-pond spawn-on-kelp fisheries. 
Closed pond fisheries model the impoundment (ponding) of fish from the 
spawning stock. Fish are captured via purse-seines and then towed 
to and subsequently transferred into a closed net-pen (pond), within which 
herring will spawn on blades of kelp (usually *Macrocystus integrifolia*) 
[@schweigert2018a]. Ponded fish are removed from the spawning 
stock biomass for the remainder of the year, and then reunited with the
main population after losses to pond-induced mortality. Closed pond SOK 
fisheries are included as input data in the historical period, and 
simulated in the projection period.

The instantaneous ponding induced mortality rate was fixed at 
$M_{SOK} = 0.315$/yr in the history, based on an average observed loss of 
27\% of ponded biomass [@shields1982a]; however, the true value is 
unknown and possibly dependent on environmental factors, general stock 
health, tow distance, pond density, and operator handling [@shields1982a;
@schweigert2018a]. Therefore, we tested an alternative
higher ponding induced mortality rate in closed-loop simulations, with 
$M_{SOK} = 1.05$/yr, corresponding to 65\% dead ponded biomass 
[@schweigert2018a]. 

In an open-pond fishery, herring are not impounded but are attracted to 
a site where kelp is laid out to collect spawn, or alternatively, frames 
strung with kelp are towed to sites where herring are already spawning. 
Open-pond SOK harvesting induces lower mortality on mature fish, and its 
impact on the stock is primarily through egg loss [@shelton2014a]. 
Landings data for open-pond SOK fisheries are not available, so open pond
SOK fisheries are only modeled in the projection time period. To simulate 
an open pond SOK fishery in the projections, we reduced to $M_{SOK} = 0$ 
and replaced the biomass vulnerable to the Seine-Roe fishery with the 
total mature spawning biomass, because there is no impounding and 
associated gear selectivity.



### Historical scenarios

The historical operating model scenarios were a grid of 18 HG herring
stock hypotheses, comprising a fully factorial design over three factors 
(Table \@ref(tab:omGridTable)). The OM factors for generating the grid were 
age-1 natural mortality rates (3 levels), stock-recruit steepness (3 levels), 
and whether projected time-varying mortality random walk deviations were 
identical or correlated among sub-areas (2 levels). The age-1 and time-varying 
natural mortality factor levels were chosen to increase variation in
operating model estimates of unfished biomass and current stock status at
those levels, and the time-varying natural mortality and steepness factor levels
were chosen to maximise the variation in future population dynamics.

Age-1 natural mortality rate factor levels were, from lowest to highest, the 
sub-area time-averaged 2+ rate (**a1Mmean**, around 0.72 on average), 1.25 
(**a1M1.25**), or 1.64 (**a1M1.64**). The latter two age-1 rates were chosen 
via a likelihood profile for a grid of rates ranging between 0.6 and 2.0 [REFS], 
where 1.25 was the most likely value (lowest data log-likelihood value), and 
1.64 had the same log-likelihood value as the **a1Mmean** operating model 
[FIG?]. Stock-recruit steepness values were low ($h = 0.5$, **sr0.5**), 
medium ($h = 0.67$, **sr0.67**), and high ($h = .8$, **sr0.8**), where
the medium value was taken from the current herring operating model prior
mean value for steepness, and $h=0.5$ and $h=0.8$ span a common range
for stock-recruit steepness. Finally, the time-varying M scenarios either
treated $M_{2+,p,t}$ random walk deviations as identical across areas when 
fitting operating models (i.e., same trends but different scales; **identM**), 
or independently estimated among sub-areas (i.e., different trends and scales;
**diffM**). For the **diffM** case, projected random walk deviations were 
correlated, with the correlation matrix estimated from historical
deviations. Historical scenario labels were defined by concatenating factor level 
labels for the corresponding operating model hypotheses, separated
by an underscore. For example, the hypothesis using sub-area mean 
age-1 mortality, with low steepness, and different M deviations had the 
label **a1Mmean_sr0.5_diffM**.

**NOTES ON GRID, I.E, a1M HAS LARGEST EFFECT ON CURRENT STOCK STATUS?**


### Projection scenarios

We evaluated four operating model projection scenarios combining two 
future trends in natural mortality with two SOK post-ponding mortality 
rates. The natural mortality scenarios involve a random walk with a 
trend that decreases age 2+ $M_{2+,p,t}$ to the historical average
$\bar{M}_{2+,p}$ over periods of 5 years (**rw5**) or 15 years (**rw15**). 
Both of these scenarios are somewhat optimistic given recent trends in 
estimated natural mortality, but they do provide scenarios where 
rebuilding procedure behaviour is revealed because fisheries would be 
occurring. The post-ponding mortality ($M_{SOK}$) is randomly drawn in 
the projections using a log-normal distribution 
$logM_{SOK,t}~N(logM_{SOK},\sigma_{M_{SOK}})$ in either (i) a lower 
post-ponding M scenario (**loPondM**), where $M_{SOK}=0.315$ 
(corresponding to survival rate of 73\%) based on total mortality 
estimates from closed-ponding in Haida Gwaii that exclude bird predation 
and post-release mortality [@shields1982a], or (ii) a higher post-ponding 
M scenario (**hiPondM**) where $M_{SOK}=1.05$ (corresponding to survival 
rate of 35\%) based on the assumed mortality estimate (65 short tons) used 
by DFO for allocating quota to closed ponds [@schweigert2018a]. For both 
scenarios, the $logM_{SOK}$ distributions had a standard deviation of
$\sigma_{M_{SOK}}=0.2$. Operating model scenarios were labeled by 
concatenating the above factor names (i.e., **rw5_loPondM**, 
**rw5_hiPondM**, **rw15_loPondM**, **rw15_hiPondM**). All scenarios 
assumed zero post-ponding mortality for open-pond SOK fisheries, but 
account for egg loss by removing open-ponded fish from the spawning 
stock when generating recruitment.

## Management procedures

We evaluated 8 different fishing RPs that used an empirical assessment 
method, two different HCRs (QUESTION: Do we want to show bout HCRs or 
just the HCR with LCP=0.3B0 and UCP=B0) and 4 different area and 
allocation rules. We also tested an RP with no fishing (**NoFish**). 
Each RP is applied independently to each area, with the exception of 
SOK licensing allocation rules due to a constraint on the total number 
of annual licenses available for Haida Gwaii.

### Assessment methods

Rebuilding procedures used a survey-based method to forecast stock status 
and biomass (and therefore TACs) 1-year ahead in each area given the 
spawn index estimate from the dive survey and the catch in the current 
year, i.e.,

\begin{equation}
  \hat{B}_{p,t+1}=I_{p,t}/\bar{q}_{p} + C_{p,t}
\end{equation}

where $B_{p,t}$ is the estimated spawning biomass, $C_{p,t}$ is the total
removals (dead fish) in biomass units, $\bar{q}_{p}$ is an average 
catchability coefficient for the blended index weighted by the OM 
grid (TO DO: Update based on weightings determined by TWG), $I_{p,t}$ is 
the dive survey spawn index for area $p$ at time $t$. This forecast assumes 
that biomass available for fishing next year will be the same as the 
estimates of fishable biomass this year. This “naïve” forecast is needed 
because the survey occurs after fishing in each year, while a spawn index 
is needed before fishing to determine a TAC. This differs from current 
practice where the assessment model makes a 1-year ahead forecast given 
estimated biomass and forecasted recruitment. Future work may evaluate 
such model-based rebuilding procedures if necessary. 

### Harvest control rules

Two spatial harvest control rule were used to set the annual total 
allowable catch (TAC) in each area (C\S, JP\S, Lou). The empirical 
estimate of spawning biomass $\hat{B}_{p,t}$ for each area was used to 
determine the target harvest rate via two ramped (hockey stick) harvest 
control rules (Figure \@ref(fig:hcrfig)) with a reference (i.e., target) 
harvest rate of 10\%, and different lower and upper control points (LCP, 
UCP) for relative stock status (i.e., $B/B_{0}$):

1. **HS50-60+HR0.1**: $LCP=0.5B_{0}$, $UCP=0.6B_{0}$, Reference Harvest 
Rate $U = 10\%$
2. **HS30-100+HR0.1**: $LCP=0.3B_{0}$, $UCP=B_{0}$, Reference Harvest 
Rate $U = 10\%$

Stock status is calculated as the empirical estimate of spawning 
biomass $\hat{B}_{p,t+1}$ divided by the average operating model 
unfished biomass $\bar{B}_{0_{p}}$, equally weighted according to 
the OM grid.

For example, for the **HS30-100+HR0.1** rule when the stock is below the 
lower control point ($B/B_{0}<0.3B_{0}$) the target harvest rate was set 
to zero, and when the stock was at or above the upper control point 
($B/B_{0} \geq B_{0}$) the target harvest rate was set to 10\%. The 
harvest rate was linearly interpolated between 0\% and 10\% when biomass 
was between these two control points. The spatial harvest control rule 
set the total TAC for each area, which was then allocated among SOK and 
seine roe fisheries according to the allocation rules defined above under 
each fishery scenario. For SOK fisheries, the total biomass of ponded fish 
required to produce the full TAC of SOK product was estimated using the 
conversion factor $\psi_{p,t}$ (TO DO: Insert Table with SISCAH OM 
notation).


### Allocation rules

Four different spatial and fishery allocation rules were defined to allow 
different types of fisheries to take place in the C/S, JP/S, and Lou 
sub-areas. None of the allocation rules allowed commercial fishing in 
Louscoone. Details of the fishing scenarios and allocation rules for 
total allowable catch (TAC) used in simulations are as follows:

1.	Closed pond SOK fishery (**cSOK**): A maximum of 10 closed pond 
licenses were allocated in Haida Gwaii across all 3-sub areas in each 
year, of which there can only be 1 in C/S and 1 in Lou sub-areas. Each 
license was allocated 16,000 lbs of SOK product, which required a minimum 
of 90.7 metric tonnes (100 short tons) of herring TAC to allow SOK fishing 
in a given area. If $TAC$ was sufficient for all 3 areas, then one license 
was allocated to C/S, one license to Lou and eight licenses to JP/S. For 
example, given that $TAC = 250$ t in C/S, $TAC = 100$ t in Lou, and 
$TAC = 1500$ t in JP/S, then one license (90.7 t) would be allocated to 
both C/S and Lou, and anoth 8 licenses (725.6 t) to JP/S. The remaining 
TAC of 159.3 t in C/S, 9.3 t in Lou, and 774.4 t in JP/S would be 
foregone. Alternatively, given that $TAC = 50$ t in C/S, $TAC = 80$ t in Lou, 
and $TAC = 1500$ t in JP/S, there would be insufficient $TAC$ to allocate a 
license to C/S and Lou, therefore, all 10 SOK licenses (907 t) would be 
allocated to JP/S. The remaining $TAC$ of 50 t in C/S, 80 t in Lou, and 
593 t in JP/S would be foregone.

2.	Open pond SOK fishery (**oSOK**): An open pond SOK fishery using 
the same license allocation rules described for **cSOK**, except that 
the $TAC$ required per license is 31.7 metric tonnes (35 short tons).

3.	Seine roe fishery (**SR**): All available $TAC$ for JP/S is allocated 
to the seine roe fishery. A minimum $TAC$ of 300 t is required to open the 
seine roe fishery, based on the lowest levels of fishing observed in the 
historical time series. There is no SR fishing in C/S or Lou.

4.	Closed pond SOK + seine roe fishery (**cSOK+SR**): The same rules 
as **cSOK** are used, except additional $TAC$ not allocated to cSOK 
licenses in JP/S is allocated to the seine roe fleet. For example, in 
the second cSOK scenario above, all 10 SOK licenses (907 t) would be 
allocated to JP/S and the 593 t remaining TAC is allocated to seine roe 
fisheries. Note, however, that, as in 3), the seine roe fishery still 
requires a minimum $TAC = 300$ t to open.

## Bridging Analyses

The previous MSE cycle for Haida Gwaii evaluated the performance of 
candidate RPs over a 15-year projection period (2019-2033), using a 
density-dependent mortality (DDM) operating model as the reference 
scenario for simulation testing [e.g. ISCAM DDM; @benson2020a; @dfo2020b]. 
The DDM scenario assumes future natural mortality rates return to the 
long-term historical M average over 15-years, implemented in the same 
way as the rw15 SISCAH projection scenario described above. In addition, 
the DDM scenario adds a low-frequency (1/16 years) and high-natural 
mortality pulse ($1.5M$) when biomass drops below 30\% of operating 
model $B_0$ to simulate conditions where low spawning biomass may 
lead to serious harm for the stock. To compare the current MSE with 
the previous MSE cycle, we fit the base SISCAH operating model with 
(SSICAH 2019) and withouth the 2019 data (SISCAH 2018) and tested 
modified versions of the SR RP applied for the aggregate area. The 
aggregate SR RP (**aggSR**) uses the same survey-based assessment method 
to forecast stock status and biomass described above, except calculates 
spawning biomass for the aggregate area, i.e.,:

\begin{equation}
  \hat{B}_{t+1}=I_{t}/q + C_{t}
\end{equation}

where $B_{t}$ is the estimated aggregate spawning biomass for Haida 
Gwaii, $C_{t}$ is the total removals (dead fish) in biomass units,
$q$ is an average catchability coefficient for the blended index for 
the operating model used (e.g. SISCAH 2019 and SISCAH 2018)

We tested two versions of the aggSR RP, one with the same 
**HS50-60+HR0.1** HCR used in the spatial RPs (**aggSR\_50-60HS+0.1HR**),
(QUESTION: Do we need to show both of these or is the 30-60HS+0.1HR 
sufficient) and a second using a HCR with a lower control point of 
30\% (**aggSR\_30-60HS+0.1HR**) of operating model unfished biomass 
($B_0$) that was used in the previous MSE cycle. In both cases the 
TAC is allocated among areas in proportion to the spawning index biomass 
in each area, i.e.
\begin{equation}
	TAC_{p,t+1}=TAC_{t+1}*I_{p,t}/I_{t} 
\end{equation}
Results of the bridging analysis are provided in Table 4.

## Rebuilding performance measures

Stock status indicators were all measured using the true operating 
model spawning stock biomass in each sub-area for a given OM scenario 
(or sum over the three sub-areas for aggregated statistics) and catch 
over 3 Herring generations from the first projection year (2020). We use 
the average age in the unfished spawning stock to calculate a herring 
generation via a weighted average of area-specific generation times 
[@seber1997a], rounded to 15 years for 3 generations [@dfo2020b]. We 
used a limited reference point (LRP) objective to maintain greater 
than 75\% probability that total HG spawning biomass remains above 
an LRP equal to 30\% of total unfished biomass, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  P(\sum_{p=1}^3 B_{p,t} > 0.3\sum_{p=1}^3 B_{0,p}) \geq 0.75,
\end{equation}
approximated by the proportion of projection years (across all 
replicates) where aggregated spawning biomass exceeded 
$0.3\sum_{p} B_{0_{p}}$. Fishery performance statistics included (i) number 
of years with openings, (ii) number of SOK licenses 
allowed to operate, (iii) average catch, (iv) average interannual catch 
variability, and v) proportion of years where harvest rate exceeds the 
target. Fishery statistics were calculated for each simulation replicate 
and then summarized via medians over all 100 replicates. Catch and SOK 
license statistics excluded years with no fishing and therefore 
expressed median values for years when fisheries were open. The equations 
for performance statistics are provided in **Table X (TO DO: add PM 
equations table) and projection results are shown in Table X (TO DO: add 
PM Table)**.

We present only tables showing perfromance metrics for the aggregated 
areas with RPs using the HS30-100+HR0.1 HCR. Additional performance 
metrics for sub-areas are provided in an appendix **(TO DO: Reference 
Appendix tables here)**
